**Headline:** Restoring the Lost Voice of Economics


In the mid-1970s, the legendary Cambridge economist Joan Robinson visited North America to deliver a series of lectures at Stanford and Queen’s University.

At the time, the economic world looked vastly different. When Robinson stood at the podium in 1975, the 🇺🇸 U.S. nominal GDP was approximately 🔟✖️ larger than 🇨🇳 China’s. Today, that gap has closed dramatically. As we approach 2025, the U.S. remains the nominal leader (projected at ~1.5x China’s GDP), but China has held the top spot by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) since 2014.

Robinson's voice—both literal and metaphorical—has never been more relevant. We seem to have passed "peak globalization," and the world is once again grappling with persistent trade imbalances and the very "beggar-thy-neighbour" policies she famously analyzed.

Unfortunately, the only existing recordings of these lectures are degraded field tapes with poor audio fidelity.

Introducing: *restoring-robinson*

Introducing a project to use modern AI audio processing (stem separation, transcription, and voice cloning) to restore these lost tapes. The goal is to train a model on her specific vocal timbre and re-generate her arguments with high fidelity and accurate inflection.

Robinson was a fierce critic of neoclassical orthodoxy. In an era of trade wars and shifting global power, it is time we heard her clearly again.
