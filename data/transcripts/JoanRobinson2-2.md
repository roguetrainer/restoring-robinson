# **Summary: Q\&A Session \- The Crisis in Economic Theory**

This file covers the Question and Answer session following Joan Robinson's lecture on the "Crisis in Economic Theory." The session is characterized by a spirited and sometimes contentious debate between Robinson and members of the audience (likely faculty and graduate students).

### **Key Debates and Themes**

* **Logic vs. Empiricism:**  
  * An audience member challenges Robinson's dismissal of General Equilibrium theory, arguing that purely logical criticisms ("this notion is absurd") are not enough; one must show empirically that the model fails to predict real-world outcomes.  
  * Robinson counters that the theory is logically inconsistent on its own terms because it cannot handle time. She argues that comparing two static equilibrium positions cannot explain the *process* of moving from one to the other.  
* **Equilibrium as Tautology:**  
  * A questioner suggests that equilibrium models are useful "pictures" or "parables" that help organize thinking, even if they are tautologies.  
  * Robinson rejects this, calling it a "methodological error." She argues that using a timeless, static model to explain a dynamic, historical process (like accumulation) is fundamentally flawed.  
* **The "Reswitching" Controversy:**  
  * The debate touches on the "reswitching" of techniques (part of the Cambridge Capital Controversy). Robinson argues that neoclassical theory relies on the assumption that lower interest rates always lead to more capital-intensive techniques. Sraffa proved this is not always true (reswitching), which destroys the logical basis for the neoclassical production function.  
* **Time and History:**  
  * Robinson repeatedly emphasizes that economic time is irreversible ("the past is irrevocable and the future is unknown"). Neoclassical models treat time like space—something you can move back and forth in—which renders them useless for analyzing real-world problems like investment and growth.

# **Transcript**

**Introducer:** ...Professor Paul David... I would like to speak just very briefly...

**Paul David:** ...is in sympathy with many of the things which I heard Mrs. Robinson say in the beginning of her lecture...

*\[Audio is initially faint and somewhat difficult to transcribe due to distance from the microphone\]*

...I heard very clearly the answer that neoclassical economics was an inadequate analytical approach. I did not hear the question to which that was the answer. I did not hear a statement about the character of the problem to which this analytical apparatus was to be addressed.

And this is essentially the same point that Jonathan \[unclear surname\] has just made. The attack on neoclassical theory as inadequate and useless... is one...

**Joan Robinson:** \[Interrupting\] Can I answer that?

**Paul David:** ...where I have a difficulty because I did not hear an attack on the logic of the Walrasian system or on the logic... the internal logical consistency of Arrow-Debreu equilibrium. What I heard was something which is well known to people who are interested in the peculiar kinds of problems which occupied me as an economic historian. But the neo-classical economics is a fundamentally ahistorical system. It was conceived patterned on classical mechanics. It one reads Walras or Jevons, one sees that it was their objective to create a physical mathematical system which...

**Joan Robinson:** ...would do exactly what classical mechanics did. It would show how a system would converge to an equilibrium, a steady state, which would perpetuate itself.

**Paul David:** Now, I think it's quite clear... I'll just have one more word on this... that those of us who regard ourselves... who are interested in historical processes... obviously are conscious that the system of general equilibrium as it has been worked out... to produce... organic solutions in which the past has no influence over the state to which the system converges, is not going to illuminate the nature of historical questions. But it seems that the question which I would like to hear you respond to is: Do you think there is any range of problems with which economists should be concerned which are which can be treated by methods other than the methods of history... of history...

**Joan Robinson:** ...with mixed feelings because I would like you to say no. Everyone must become an economic historian.

**Paul David:** ...and therefore...

**Joan Robinson:** Well, let me speak to the point. It seems to me that this business about Arrow-Debreu... is a red herring because Arrow-Debreu is not even trying to tell us anything about the problems we are interested in, such as the process of accumulation, the distribution of income. They have a world in which nothing is of any interest or importance except the prices of commodities. That seems to me to be a very narrow line. So that even if they are right... it's not interesting.

But I was accusing Samuelson of making a definite mistake. Such a mistake that you shouldn't allow a first-year student to make it. And that is depicting different positions of equilibrium and then, without any further explanation, assuming that you can move from one to the other by a process of accumulation. I mean this confusion between comparisons and processes... this is a definite mistake.

The other mistake is thinking that you can derive from the productivity to society as a whole... of an increment in the means of production... to the rate of profit on capital in the capitalist economy. But there is absolutely no relation at all between this rate of return... and the rate of profit. Just by purely verbal jugglery they get you into thinking that they have got a theory of profits. But they haven't at all.

Now... let's consider... let's go back to this Walrasian economy... uh... Harry Johnson...

Now as you can compare two economies... one has a larger lump of putty than the other. That's to say it has more of some inputs and not less of any other inputs. So it can be represented by a larger lump of putty.

So then Johnson would say that in the second economy you have a lower... higher price of putty... and a higher real wage. And you can work that out... and fill in all the details... of what.

Now where would you find the highest ratio of capital per man by any of these measures? Where would you find it?

**Audience Member:** ...

**Robinson:** Well, certainly it used to be highest in the United States. I don't know if you've gone down relative to Japan so much... but the high capital-labor ratio is in the United States. Now does this mean that you have a lower rate of profit on capital than any other country?

It's... it's a totally absurd... uh... way of approaching it.

So... all right, let us let them have their capital... measure capital... doesn't matter. Uh... Samuelson... as a matter of fact in his "Surrogate Production Function"... although he wasn't quite aware of what he was doing until later... he measured stocks of capital in terms of labor embodied. And he made out a list of different economies... one with more capital in terms of labor embodied than the other... and arranged them in order... and said that the rate of interest would be lowest where the capital per man in terms of labor embodied was highest.

Well, all right, that's a... he puts that forward as a hypothesis... I don't know what it's supposed to correspond to but he puts it forward as a hypothesis.

And then he goes on to say the process of accumulation will lower the rate of profit.

Now you're going to bring accumulation into it\! It's no good starting with your timeless equilibrium. You've got to tell us: What kind of economy this is? How does accumulation take place? Is it done by business firms? Or is it a... what is it? Property-owning democracy in which households do the saving and somehow convey their savings... that's never been explained how... to be used for investment?

What are the motives which guide investment? Under what influence does it take place? How does it react on the technique of production?

See... this idea of having a given state of technical knowledge... embodied in... expressed in a production function... is totally... out of relation with whatever happens. See, you work out these figures of output... share of wages... ratio of capital to output and capital to labor. You know, those those figures that they do. Then they put a Cobb-Douglas production function...

You will always fit a Cobb-Douglas production function if the relative shares in your figures happen to be fairly constant. That doesn't prove anything.

But supposing relative shares are fairly constant... and the capital-output ratio in value terms is fairly constant... doesn't change very much... and the share of wages in value added doesn't change very much... and output is rising. So... you've got rising real wages... and a constant rate of profit. The share is constant... the capital-output ratio is constant... then the rate of profit on capital is constant. So ex-post average realized profits... in this period of time... fairly constant.

Now what's the good of trying to fit a Cobb-Douglas? Because here you have a position where each point of observation at each date is drawn from a different technology. You haven't got a production function you go creeping down it with the rate of profit falling as the real wage rises. Far from it. The real wage is rising... the rate of profit is constant. That's to say there's technical change going on such that... each point of observation is drawn from a different technology.

And so what you've got to consider is... how accumulation actually goes on... who gains and who benefits from... who gains and who loses from accumulation... and how accumulation influences and is influenced by technical change.

And your production function... and your equilibrium... have absolutely nothing to tell you... at all... in any respect... to help you to analyze a capitalist economy. So... this whole teaching is a total loss.

And the reasons... two major reasons are, as I say, that it doesn't take account of the nature of time... and it doesn't take account of the structure of society... and it's always living in a dream world.

But... following from this... is a purely methodological mistake. These people like Samuelson put on a lot of dog about how they are mathematicians. And they make the most elementary blunder in methodology... to compare two equilibrium positions... and then say... you move from one to the other by a process of accumulation. This is an error which a first-year student shouldn't be allowed to get away with. So here is the sad state of teaching today.

**Question:** ...Professor Paul David...

**Robinson:** I thought he was saying...

**Paul David:** ...but the stay's law holds...

**Robinson:** Yes... well...

**Paul David:** ...that the... if the results... the results on traversing... are... are proved for vintage models...

**Robinson:** No...

**Paul David:** ...the... the... the self-contradictory nature of equilibrium systems... is... is revealed immediately considering... how does the process of adjustment take place from one equilibrium to another?

**Robinson:** Or how do you get into equilibrium?

**Paul David:** Or how do you get into equilibrium from any... from any initial starting point? What is convenient... getting into equilibrium...

**Robinson:** Mechanical analogy breaks down... as soon as you bring in the fact that human beings take a view... about what is going to happen next.

**Paul David:** Well but that... that's precisely the point... that... that the models have been set up... not to explain how a real world system gets into equilibrium... The models have been set up for the purpose of showing that... this is the kind of structure... which will... converge... to a steady state from any initial position. And that the kinds of models that people work on... because they're mathematically tractable... have an autonomous equilibrium... imposed on them.

**Robinson:** Why is it just a distraction for the moment to do... I mean tell me the value of it? You make a... model in which you have perfect information...

**Paul David:** ...it's not...

**Robinson:** ...perfect foresight...

**Paul David:** ...it's not...

**Robinson:** ...and everybody knows exactly what everybody else is going to do...

**Paul David:** ...it's not perfect foresight...

**Robinson:** ...and you show...

**Paul David:** ...it's not perfect foresight...

**Robinson:** ...that there is a position... which would be stable... if you once hit upon it. Now what does that tell you about the world we live in?

**Paul David:** It tells you what... the... implications... of... a specific set of assumptions... assumptions about... behavior... are.

**Robinson:** But we know the assumptions are wrong\!

**Paul David:** It tells you... no... it...

**Robinson:** We know the future is uncertain... expectations are liable to be disappointed...

**Paul David:** It tells you that if...

**Robinson:** ...major decisions are taken by big corporations... and not by the market...

**Paul David:** ...if you hold those views... then... you... cannot... expect... the world... to behave... in the way... in which... a general equilibrium system... behaves.

**Robinson:** Well I know that\! I don't need a heavy book of mathematics to prove that\!

**Paul David:** \[Laughter\]

**Robinson:** \[Laughter\]

**Paul David:** Well... I...

**Robinson:** No, I mean seriously... I can't see why...

**Paul David:** I really think you...

**Robinson:** ...why you need to prove... that a system which has none of the features of reality... would be stable if it existed. What's the point?

**Paul David:** \[Inaudible \- seemingly exasperated\]

**Robinson:** No, seriously...

**Paul David:** Because... because... it is...

**Robinson:** ...why do you need to prove... that a system which has none of the features of reality... would be stable if it existed. What's the point?

**Paul David:** \[Inaudible\]

**Audience Member:** ...Mrs. Robinson... may I...

**Robinson:** Yes?

**Audience Member:** ...from the discussion of... Mrs. Robinson... Professor Pencavel... Professor David... It seems to me there is a little confusion on the level of the discussion.

It seems to me that there are three fundamental points.

One: What are the questions Professor David that we are addressing? What do we want to explain with the model?

The second one... is for any given model... the checking... of its logical consistency.

The third one... which is the most important one... is the problem of real science. What's real science?

What I understand from the discussion of Mrs. Robinson... that you want basically to explain... how economics... going and evoluting... through time periods. How really a given economy... is changing... and developing.

The next question was that... she was continuing with attacking basically... the Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium system.

The Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium system... given its assumption... is completely logically consistent. Given the assumption of convexity... the existence of all contingent markets... it gives some... existent proof... and you can prove also the Pareto optimality.

The question... is it relevant? Mrs. Robinson says it's not relevant... because it doesn't explain really how economies move through time... when there are changes... on the problem of adjustment and stability.

I think the majority of... the people around here... attack also the problem of real science. By observing... the real world... it seems... that the basic assumptions... also in the argument of... as if... are... and also the prediction... seems to be far... from... this given model.

It seems like... Mrs. Robinson I think specified a couple of points... what's wrong in this explanation.

The first point as I see was the problem of... ambiguity... uncertainty... future risk.

The second point was... approaching the nature of the economy... through kind of... not through equilibrium concept... but through disequilibrium concept... and by that... looking at economy in different states... kind of time.

Then she was continued to mention the problem... of increasing return to scale... the existence in this world... if you want to explain this world... of big corporations... and she was concluding with... the contradiction between the... relation between the capital labor ratio... and the rate of profit.

I think many of us are aware... that given this world... observing this world... these problem exist. And as I see for example the... Arrow-Debreu school the way it's going these days... is basically is... trying to address this point.

The approach is taking the basic model... with... its basic... assumptions... and... which don't explain basically what's going on... and to try to modify it. To try to bring some concept of uncertainty... to try to bring some concept of non-convexity... etc.

Is this approach will be useful or no... this is a question. Till now it doesn't seem to help so much... but that's a question.

The question I want to address Mrs. Robinson... more concrete terms... I think many of us were feeling that... the lack of ability of a given theory... to explain what's going on... and to give us... a picture about... the world... whatever it is.

To be more concrete for example... Mrs. Robinson... to the point of risk... she said for example there was attempt in neoclassical theory... to approach risk through... expected utility... or in terms of stochastic processes... she basically... tried to say that we have to... ignore the problem of probability... and to... try to... approach expectation in a different way. Perhaps she was also in the back of her mind the attack on the maximization of utility... and get rid of the rationality... and to try to go to different ways.

What I would like... to hear from... from you... Mrs. Robinson... more specific way... we agree basically that many things are wrong in neoclassical theory... but if you would like to pursue a new way... what specifically... I understand that you have to bring this concept... I think... the majority of the problem lies that we are... seems unable really to do it. It's not only the lack of will in some way. And I would like perhaps if you have more specific suggestion... how to approach the problem.

**Robinson:** Well... this business about Arrow-Debreu... I think is a red herring because Arrow-Debreu is not even trying to tell us... anything about the problems we are interested in... such as the process of accumulation... the distribution of income... They have a world in which nothing is of any interest or importance except the prices of commodities. That seems to me to be a very narrow line.
