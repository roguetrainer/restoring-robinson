Here is the transcript and a summary of the lecture "Doomsday is Today" by Joan Robinson, delivered at Queen's University.

### **Summary of the Lecture**

**Speaker:** Joan Robinson (Prominent post-Keynesian economist).   
**Context:** The second Chancellor Dunning Trust Lecture (likely 1974).    
**Topic:** A critique of orthodox economic growth theories, the crisis of global poverty, and the role of the West in the "Third World."   

**Key Arguments:**
* **The "Doomsday" Reality:** Robinson argues that while scientists warn of a future "Doomsday" regarding population and resources, for hundreds of millions in the Third World, doomsday is already here. She criticizes the academic tendency to calculate future carrying capacities while ignoring present starvation.
* **Critique of Foreign Aid:** She views Western "aid" largely as hypocrisy, arguing it is often "anti-aid" (specifically arms sales) that supports military-industrial complexes rather than helping the poor.
* **The "Chinese Model":** Robinson speaks favorably of the People's Republic of China (based on her visits since 1953). She contrasts the starvation in capitalist developing nations with China’s system of communes, militias, and basic social guarantees (food, housing, medical care), suggesting China succeeded by rejecting foreign capital and relying on self-sufficiency.
* **The Trap of Foreign Investment:** She argues that foreign capital (e.g., in Brazil) creates a "high-consumption" middle class dependent on Western goods while leaving the masses in poverty. She cites Japan as the only capitalist nation to develop successfully because it strictly excluded foreign capital.
* **Canadian Nationalism:** She urges Canadians to reject "complacency" and develop a form of "genuine patriotism"—not chauvinism, but a pride that resists being a "running dog" of the United States. She suggests Canada should focus on making itself a "good country to live in" rather than mimicking US consumption patterns.
* **Role of Social Scientists:** She calls for economists to abandon the "aping" of natural sciences (physics/math) and admit that economics is largely political and ideological. She urges a "high level of self-criticism" within the profession.

### **Transcript**

**[00:00] James Courtright (Vice Principal of Development):** ...This is the second in the Chancellor Dunning Trust lecture series, and last, by Professor Robinson. The first one on Monday, you will recall, was entitled "Growth in Economics." And it seemed very appropriate that the person who had the high honor of introducing Professor Robinson was James Courtright, Vice Principal of Development.

Today's lecture is entitled "Doomsday is Today." I'm not sure what significance that has for political scientists. Perhaps we are, after all, as political scientists, displacing economics as *the* dismal science.

Jim Courtright, at the end of the lecture on Monday, had suggested that perhaps there were many economists around Queen's who would go home that night and sleep rather fitfully. I can assure him, and you, that as a political scientist, I went home and slept soundly. However, I have to confess to you that it was only after I had offered up a silent prayer of thanks that the powers that be had decided to make Joan Robinson an economist and not a political scientist.

I'm told by Frank Flatters of the Department of Economics that I ought not to have been astonished that Joan Robinson, last day, had decided to take on the whole of the discipline of economics at one fell swoop. In fact, he said, she has taken on all of the Nobel Prize winners in economics, and I don't have to tell you, after Monday's session, what the outcome of that battle was.

It's very difficult to ask a person... to give a person the honor that I feel in presenting Professor Robinson to you for the second time, and to give me so little time in which to do it. When I looked over her publications, I think I stopped counting at the 20th book, figuring there's no point to go on. And her articles were too incalculable to try to even examine.

And... she's a... the color of her personality, the range of interests that she has, her travels 'round the world, the imprint that she's left in many countries—China (at least twice), People's Republic of China that is, North Korea, Mexico, India most recently, and so on—that is the kind of person that you would like to be able to talk about. And, given the slightest encouragement, I'm willing to occupy a great deal of time in doing so. But, with the next speaker who it is, I know I shall have no encouragement at all.

Nevertheless, there is one thing that I'd like to say about her, just one thing. And it's something that I'm sure you have already felt, but I think that it needs to be brought into focus. Society, as Professor Robinson has pointed out, has been captivated by the ethics of growth without knowing what it's growing for. We might also say that the social sciences have been captured by the same ethic, as well they may, being part of the society in which it is done.

And in being captured by it, we find an enormous proliferation of the social sciences. In fact, the GNPP—the Gross National Productivity of Publications in the social sciences—is known to us all. It's a function in part of the very things that economists from Adam Smith on at least have been telling us about, namely the increase in the specialization of labor. And with the increase in the specialization of labor in the social sciences has come the fractioning... the breaking up of the social sciences into a number of specialties. The specialties have developed sub-specialties. And the sub-specialties are now in the process of developing their own sub-specialties: special schools, institutes, interdisciplinary sciences that take on the character of the interstices of two or more sciences, social sciences, and so on.

The consequences of this growth in the social sciences are no less disastrous in one sense than the consequences of a mindless growth in society. They have done two things:

One: They have chopped up the real world, the world of real problems, into small pieces so that we have a political aspect, and an economic aspect, and a sociological, a structural aspect, and a cultural aspect, and so on, to which only the specialist can address himself. There is no one left to address himself to the *human* problem, which is indivisible and undivided.

At the same time, because of the high level of technical development that specialization brings, it has become difficult if not impossible for the disciplines to speak with each other. So one hears constant reference to the fact, "Oh, that's an economic problem, I know nothing about it," or "a political problem, you better ask the political scientist." Or, we were told on Monday, "the answer to every economic problem is a political question."

And even within the disciplines, the sub-specialties are finding increasing difficulty in talking with each other so that you have a virtual Babel of tongues among the disciplines. And this may seem like a very long and indirect way of saying that it is enormously refreshing to find someone of great eminence in her own field, an unquestioned competence as a specialist, who has found a way of communicating with laymen—and we are all, those of us who are not economists, are laymen from the point of view of the field of economics. And she's found a way of communicating with us about whole human social problems without in any way denaturing or undermining the competence that she has as an economist.

So, if I use the language of the subjects of political science who are politicians, I say that I can say that I present to you, for the second time this week, a person who has found a way of speaking to the people and who can understand the people when they speak to her. Professor Robinson.

**[Applause]**

**[08:52] Joan Robinson:** Well, thank you very much. I think it's a very cruel custom to have the chairman praise the speaker before the speech has begun, because as you're sitting there, you're always wondering, you know, whether people after all will be disappointed.

But as for this question of experts... you see, I know if I'm an expert, well then I know what experts are worth. And this has always given me a great strength in meeting these people who set themselves up to understand politics, economics, society. They don't understand it any more than I understand economics.

**[Laughter]**

Well, I'm sorry I took a rather melodramatic title for this lecture. Actually, the organizer rang me up and said, "What's the title of your lecture?" And so I said, the second lecture: "Doomsday is Today." But now I come to think of it, it's rather tiresomely melodramatic.

But what I mean is this: that people are continually calculating how many people, how many human bodies the world could support, how many it could feed, how much energy needs to be consumed, and depicting a situation—sometimes they put it as far as 100 years away, sometimes they put it more or less next week—but anyway, it's in the future that this terrible crisis is going to be upon us.

But if you consider how many people there are in the world today *already* who are hungry, what's the point of calculating how long it will be before the food supplies of the world won't support the population? The situation already exists. And this is, after all, very well known because now we all read the papers and see news on the telly and so on.

And I think the difficulty is to take in, to react to, to feel a concern about so many horrors that there are in the world today. And so it begins to become a kind of commonplace. For instance, at the present time it seems the Sahara is moving south, whole peoples having their existence threatened. We know the situation in India, for instance, or still worse in Bangladesh. A country in which the population is growing very rapidly. The, up 'til now, food supplies just almost keeping up with the growth of numbers, but the food is not getting to the people who want to eat it.

I mentioned in my last lecture the great fallacy of income per capita. Still worse if you calculate calories per capita, when in fact some people are overeating and going to the doctors, and some people are not able to feed their children. This is the situation in most of the world. Now we know, of course, in very rich countries such as the United States, even Canada, there are people living in great misery. But that sort of poverty is absolutely nothing compared to the poverty which is quite commonplace in the Third World. The situation of not being able to feed your own children is a terrible situation to be in.

But this is quite commonplace. Millions of people, hundreds of millions of people, are in that situation. So what's the good of calculating about the future when Doomsday is going to come? The situation now is a terrible one.

And the kind of discussion that goes on about aid, for instance, or an assisted takeoff... this is the most terrible hypocrisy. I'm sorry to speak in a very brutal manner, and particularly I don't think that Canada is to blame nearly as much as my own country. But the situation of the Third World is now becoming quite obvious. Since the way has been opened to China and people are allowed to know what's going on in China... I've been visiting China ever since 1953, which is only three years really after the liberation. And seeing stages of development. And come back and tell people what was going on. And the usual reaction was, "Oh, you know Joan." And nobody will take it seriously.

Now, now everybody goes to China and everybody tells us that the people there are well fed. That everybody is being educated. That the standard of honesty in public life and in private life is something which exists nowhere else in the world. That the cooperation between the government and the people, the confidence of the authorities of the people and the people in the authorities, is something which certainly doesn't exist in most countries.

Now you say, well here you are again, you're telling us these stories, how do we know? Well, I'll tell you one fact. I'll tell you one fact which is not in dispute. You know they have a militia. The young men and girls in every village are trained in rifle shooting, grenades, elementary military training. And they keep their arms in the village. Each militia has its own arms kept in the village.

Well, this seems to me a sufficient evidence of what I was saying. And it's not disputed by anyone. Even the most embittered China watchers can't deny this simple fact.

But the main point is the level of life in the crude sense of having enough to eat, having a medical service, having social security. You know, in the communes they have a system of families—the families are expected to look after their children and look after their old people. But if there are some old people who haven't got grandchildren to look after them, they have the "Five Guarantees." That is: food, housing, clothes, fuel, and a decent funeral.

So that you have a level of social security, as we like to call it, in this great Asian country... at the simple level, of course, of their own standard of life, you have complete social security. And as a consequence of this, it's possible to carry out a big drive for late marriage and small families.

Now the contrast between this situation and the situation, for instance, in India, Bangladesh, in Latin America and so on, is quite staggering. But what is the contribution that the Western world has been making to development in the Third World? It's been to prevent the Chinese formula from being followed. How many wars the United States has fought, or dragging in the United Nations making us all fight, to prevent the Chinese formula being followed?

So this seems to me to show that all the talk about the Third World and assisting development and all that is merely a kind of salve to put on our conscience and pretend that we are trying to help with these ghastly problems.

But the situation in India at the present time is a particularly tragic one. Because India had the idea of setting out to prove that there is a middle way. You can have a mixed economy which there's planning, social welfare, and at the same time capitalist enterprise and the free market. You're going to have the two side by side.

And everyone in India—I'm not saying anything that isn't common or even notorious in India—is that the governments are very corrupt and that the private sector which has got the money always wins in every case. And this grand example we were going to have of the Third Way has been, to put it mildly, very disappointing.

So here is the situation we are facing in these countries. Now there's one little bit of economics I'd like to mention in this connection, and it has also some bearing on the Canadian problems. And that is the question of foreign capital.

This is another piece of what I was saying last time, the mythology of growth. See, the orthodox economics teaching is that you have three factors of production: land and natural resources, labor, and capital. And the rich countries have a lot of this factor called capital, and the poor countries have too little capital, and they have a high ratio of labor to land, and this is the reason for their poverty. And so it can be relieved by allowing them to have some more capital. And so you get capital investment in these countries and that's going to help them to take off, and then they're going to be able to overcome their poverty and so forth.

Now this is really a piece of eyewash which is propagated by the professional economists. If you consider what is the meaning of capital? What happens? What is actually done when one country provides capital to another?

See, in one sense capital is money. In the other sense, it means machines, factories, high technology, iron and steel, physical means of production. And of course, physical means of production would be very helpful to these countries. If they had more physical means of production, they would be able to produce more. So if you're giving them some capital, you're going to give them some iron and steel, some factories, some lathes, some irrigation works.

But of course, that isn't what you give them. What you give them is some finance. The business of transferring capital from one country to another is a financial transaction. It's a matter of allowing them to have a deficit on their balance of payments without becoming bankrupt. You see, it's lending.

And this means then that they are able to import more than they could if they had to rely entirely on what they could pay for directly. So it's giving them an opportunity to have a deficit on the balance of payments. Now if they've got a consistent and well-worked-out plan for development, of course, it's very useful to them. They have some foreign exchange which they can spend on what they need for their development plan. They have a consistent, well-worked-out plan, and they know what they need, and they can buy the ingredients which they need to go into their plan of production.

But of course, that isn't how it works. Because the capital is going to go into investments which suit the firms or the countries which are giving them the capital. As far as it's inter-government so-called "Aid," the greater part of it actually goes into "Anti-Aid," that is to say into arms. Which encourage the military-industrial complex *inside* those countries to get a grip on their economies and encourages them to fight wars amongst themselves. So that all this ballyhoo about Aid is a very, very small proportion of the Anti-Aid which they've received from the Great Powers.

But then you have investment from private enterprise. From the firms which are going to set up installations in those countries. So what they are going to do is to invest in things which suits *their* flow of production. Give them an outlet for their particular products. You know the expression "Coca-Cola-nization." Well, was Coca-Cola the most necessary kind of aid to give to India and Southeast Asia? The firms naturally are going to give what it suits them to give.

Somebody, when we had questions last time, saying whose fault is it? I don't think it's anybody's fault. I mean, the capitalists are doing their stuff—being capitalists and making profits. And the workers in the countries are earning their living by following the dictates of these firms. And the people in the receiving country are receiving what is going to make some jobs and some incomes for them. Everybody's doing their stuff. It isn't sensible to look for villains. Because this is a system which we're all caught up in, and this is the way it works.

Well, this question of development through foreign investment has been analyzed by the Brazilian economist Furtado. Brazil, as you know, is having an economic miracle. Growing 10 and 12 percent per annum. Growth like anything. Now what does this growth consist of? It consists of receiving local capitalists working with the great American firms or other international firms, and they are generating a market for the kind of things that they know how to produce. Let's say washing machines and air conditioners and all kinds of fancy gadgets, of course motorcars. And they, by the same process, build up a class of people who can buy these things.

Because the firms have what Galbraith calls the "technostructure"—the salaried staff of the firms. They're also of course shareholders, but that's rather a minor part of it, I think. The main thing is that you have a huge middle class built up with salaries which enable them to buy these goods, and you have the firms making these goods. And so you develop a piece of the economy which has this very high rate of growth.

This kind of development can be seen also in India. Brazil is the leading case because Brazil is having this very rapid rate of growth, whereas India is having rather stagnation. But the same process is going on. That the capital investment is going into things which are not only not contributing to growth but are *anti-growth* precisely because they are building up tastes for a level of life which is very difficult to get rid of once you've got used to it. So that the resources of the country are being deflected while some people are—many people, the majority even—are actually hungry and the minority is living in this high style.

What is it that they're giving you when they're giving you capital? You see, they give you a little bit of finance. It's only a small bit even of finance which comes in, because a country like Canada, but even a country like India, has got a certain development of a capital market at home. So that they can borrow... they can borrow in the country. They don't even have to send you very much finance. What they send you is the organization and the know-how and the higher management for doing their particular thing. It's not what's wanted for the development of the country.

Now here again we have an absolutely unanswerable example of the point. Because the one country which succeeded in developing a native capitalism was Japan. And they did it absolutely in order to prevent foreign capital coming in. They could see what happened. They didn't want to fall into the pit which India and China had fallen into. And just in order to prevent it, they decided they were going to learn the tricks for themselves.

And so they didn't have any foreign capital, and even today they are very allergic to having foreign investment in their country. They do it to train their own people, send them abroad to learn the tricks, build up their own research, and finally now in some lines they are leading the world. They began by imitation, and then they take off.

I wouldn't like to advertise Japan because, as I was saying in last time, their growth has ruined their country. They say themselves, "We exported the blue sky." Not to mention poisoning the fish so that they can't eat their own food. So I wouldn't like to say that Japan is in a general sense a great success. But in this particular sense of finding out how to develop modern industry without foreign capital, they certainly are an example that it can be done.

So this is the way the game is played. The policy led by the United States—but I'm sorry to say a lot of other countries are "running dogs" of the United States, as the Chinese say—to keep as wide a part of the world as possible for a sphere of foreign investment and trade for the convenience of the great firms in the capitalist countries. And this seems to me to be what the situation is.

Well, what can we do? We all feel helpless. And particularly in Canada, I think people feel, well, it's not our fault, what can we do about it? And anyway, as I say, this piling up of horrors stretches one's conscience like a piece of elastic until it perishes and people simply *can't* react, can't take it in.

And so I think we ought to take a more humble sort of view of how we can make some sort of contribution. First of all, to keep out of this racket as much as possible. If we want to give aid, to give genuine aid, which is really going to help people.

I think that again this feeling about whose fault is it is nagging people. I mean, many of the people who go out to carry out missions in the Third World are extremely honest and extremely devoted people. And no doubt in little pockets here and there they do make a real contribution and do really help people. But it's the whole system, the whole scheme of things which is intended to keep alive the situation which makes aid necessary. And these very good and worthy people are caught in that.

So... one shouldn't... one shouldn't deny their good motives and in individual cases their good success. If one is looking at the system as a whole as being the reverse of what it pretends to be.

But I should like to raise the question of the situation in Canada. See, I think to make a contribution to these huge questions is really enervating because you think of what ought to be done and then you think how helpless we are and we can't do anything.

And I find this atmosphere rather in Canada. When foreigners come to Canada and they complain and say the Canadians are so complacent. So they say, "Yes, we're complacent." So they become complacent about being complacent! And then the foreigners are completely defeated.

**[Laughter]**

But I should suggest that the important thing for Canada is to try to make this country into a good country to live in. And that wouldn't be a merely selfish aim. It would be really making a contribution to the world. And this question of preservation, of saving species which are being stamped out, of reconstructing the life of the people that have been ruined—the Eskimos and Indians who've been completely ruined by being swamped by modern civilization. Would it be possible to rescue them and make a niche in which they could live like human beings? The question of conservation... of making a real attack on the ill effects of industry.

I had some hope at first that this oil crisis was going to be a salutary shock. I'm very pleased to see that General Motors is losing a lot of money because people don't want to buy large motorcars anymore. You know, what's good for General Motors is good for the United States...

**[Laughter/Applause]**

But I'm afraid it's working the other way. First of all, the energy scare is being used precisely to undermine the conservationist position in many ways. In Great Britain, we're going to have our own oil so then we'll be all right, we haven't got to bother. And the whole concept of reacting to this by reconsidering our own position seems to have been lost.

But you know, for a long time now people have been talking about the ridiculous way we live. The extreme wastefulness of our style of life. And how with very little change, and with very little cost, we could alter our style of life in all kinds of minor ways. Each one in itself is quite trivial, like returnable containers. Designing insulations first of all to last longer. Because this thing of obsolescence, manufactured obsolescence, is extremely wasteful. And then things can be, could be designed in such a way that they can be recycled, the parts can be used again, or can be organized in such a way as to need minor repairs to save the whole thing. Question of insulation of buildings.

There are an enormous number of things where technique has been designed precisely to create waste. And if we could turn it round the other way and organize our techniques so as to avoid waste, this would be a useful example to the world and would be very helpful to show what can be done.

And here I think is a situation where Canada in particular could could make a very important contribution. First of all, you've got an enormous amount of unspoiled territory. And a low density of population. And you're not so much committed to this fiendish foreign policy. You can remain detached and to some extent innocent in the large question. And therefore, although against the background of the large questions it's quite a small contribution, it would be one which you could make.

And I early in life found out one must do what one *can* and not what one *ought*. If you think of what you ought to do, of course, you're completely crushed and in fact end by doing nothing. But if you find out what you *can* do, then you can make a contribution also indirectly to the large problems.

So, although I've come laden with gloom, I would like to think that there is a possibility of a gleam of light here and there. And I think one might quite see a gleam in Canada.

I just want to say one word on the question of Nationalism. Because people say that you shouldn't be nationalistic. Nationalism is bad and reactionary and you ought to be internationalist. Now this was a doctrine which of course progressive people held. For instance, in Great Britain when we had a big Empire. And the progressive thing was to be anti-imperialist and anti-nationalist and in favor of the people who we'd been pushing around. And this gets carried forward and is preached to Canada, "You oughtn't to be nationalist."

But for Canadians to be non-nationalist just means that they're absorbed into the whole game of the United States. And for a country which is in the position of a minor country against the Great Powers, it seems to me that you don't want to have anti-nationalism. You want to have *genuine* patriotism. Because it seems to me that genuine patriotism should be to have a country that you can honestly be proud of, instead of being proud of whatever country you happen to have got.

And this is where it seems to me that the emphasis ought to lie in your discussions about the nature of nationalism in this country.

**[Applause]**

**[36:00] Chairman (James Courtright):** We have some time for questions. We can start off where we left last day. Because of the acoustics in this hall, it's essential that if you have a question, you direct it first to a mic... There are three mics in the microphones on the balcony. There are two portable microphones here. If you will identify yourself, I'll try to distribute the questions as equitably as possible throughout the hall. I'm sure you have lots on your mind from last day in addition to those that were raised today.

...

**[37:12] Questioner 1:** Thank you. I wonder if you could tell us how you could visualize in a country like Canada the people actually breaking out of the trap? I mean, I have a car which I'm paying for slowly. I find myself very concerned by my mortgage, by all of the problems that I encounter in my profession. How do I—although I agree with what you say and I admire what I know of the Chinese example—how could I break out of this trap? How do other people who feel the same way, how can they break out of it?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, the first thing is to find the others who are feeling like you.

**[Laughter/Applause]**

**[Joan Robinson]:** That you're not alone. Lots of other people have the same idea. As long as everybody remains in their hole like a hermit crab, of course they can't do anything. But there is already starting in this country quite a lot of movements on this question of pollution and preservation and so on. There's quite a lot already going on that you can cotton on to and help with. And then perhaps the movement would spread and affect other aspects of life.

**[38:43] Questioner 2:** Mrs. Robinson, last Monday night you gave us what was essentially a critique of orthodox economics. I had hoped that tonight you might have given us some indication of which economists, if there are any, you consider worth reading. Now you didn't in fact do that at all. I wonder if you might address yourself to that question now.

**[Joan Robinson]:** You're asking me to give the critique of economic theory?

**[Chairman]:** Could you repeat your question? Stand a little bit further back.

**[Questioner 2]:** Yeah. The question is, do you believe there are any economists writing now who have something constructive to say as opposed to the economists that you wrote off the other night?

**[Laughter]**

**[Joan Robinson]:** Are you a lone figure?

**[Questioner 2]:** No.

**[Joan Robinson]:** No, no I belong to a school which has kept the flame of true Keynesian economics alive. And by no means alone. And moreover the point of view which I'm maintaining is spreading quite rapidly. There are two or three centers in Canada where orthodox theory is being driven back by a different point of view.

**[Chairman]:** For those of you in the balcony, if you just proceed to the mic, I'll be able to identify you. That young lady over there.

**[40:35] Questioner 3 (Woman):** I have two questions. Could you please first tell me where these centers are?

**[Laughter]**

**[Questioner 3]:** Could you tell me where these first centers are?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Where are these professors?

**[Chairman]:** Where are these centers?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, I don't think this is really a very suitable milieu in which to discuss the technical sort of development of economics. If you catch me afterwards, I'll tell you.

**[Questioner 3]:** Well, because I tried on Monday night and I didn't get to talk to you.

**[Joan Robinson]:** What?

**[Questioner 3]:** I tried on Monday night and I didn't get to talk to you.

**[Joan Robinson]:** I can't hear you.

**[Questioner 3]:** Well perhaps if I shout... I don't like microphones especially, but it would be possible to talk to you afterwards? Like I tried on Monday but I didn't get to.

**[Joan Robinson]:** Yes, that's what I say. I don't think this is a suitable audience for discussing a matter which is sort of of interest only to economists in a narrow sense. But I'm very happy to spread the light wherever I can. If you speak to me afterwards I'll...

**[41:55] Questioner 4:** You seem to suggest that there may be a glimmer of hope for Canadians. Within that context you suggest that we have the Indians and the Eskimos as a backdrop to what we are. I would like to know, in terms of if we're to appreciate what we are as Canadians, what were to appreciate about the Indian and the Eskimo? In lieu of the James Bay Power Project, I think it's a bit too late.

**[Joan Robinson]:** What is he saying?

**[Chairman]:** What is there to appreciate about being an Eskimo...

**[Questioner 4]:** No.

**[Chairman]:** ...if the government pursues a policy...

**[Questioner 4]:** No.

**[Chairman]:** ...that rides roughshod over the needs of native people?

**[Questioner 4]:** Yes.

**[Chairman]:** And he says there's nothing very much that you can do about it. So he wonders what there still is to appreciate about being a Canadian who happens to be an Eskimo or a native person such as an Indian... if the government pursues a policy...

**[Questioner 4]:** ...like the James Bay project.

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, I haven't any detailed knowledge of the situation, but we know for instance in the United States there is a movement now of the Indian people to stand up for their rights and to find a way of living in the United States which would not deprive them of self-respect. We know that the still more miserable and ill-treated people in Australia have now began to stand up and have a political movement. They're having a rough time of course, but it seems to me that in the present stage of the world, it isn't any longer necessary for these people to be treated as debris. That it might be possible to... for the comfortably off people to help, at least to sympathize and to insist on them being allowed to have some kind of political rights. And this is one thing which... after all this is still a democratic country, isn't it? It's one thing in which ordinary citizens can help.

**[44:37] Questioner 5:** You mentioned at the beginning of your talk that there were a lot of hungry people in the world today. I wonder if the problem... if there are if there is too little food or too many people?

**[Joan Robinson]:** The potential supply of food is not being produced. And the food which is being produced is maldistributed. The people who want land in order to feed themselves are not able to get land to cultivate. Even when land reforms have been made, land reform by itself is no use unless there's organization of credit marketing and so on to enable them to live. So to put the question in this way, too many people or too little food is a... is not a very relevant way of putting the question.

**[45:52] Questioner 6:** Do you do you think there is any hope for the Western world within a capitalist framework as now exists?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, I can't really see any immediate hope of getting rid of it. And therefore it seems to me we've got to live in it for the time being at least. And perhaps try to make it a little less oppressive.

**[Questioner 6]:** Well at the beginning, at the beginning of your address you referred to your title of tonight's talk, "Doomsday Today," which would suggest that if we haven't... if we have any time left at all, there is definitely very little. And what you just said, you seem to ask for enough time to be able to mold a capitalist system to perhaps be able to improve a situation which already is, as I might take from the title of your talk, almost beyond improvement. How would you reconcile this?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, I think this is a moral problem for every individual. Am I going to sit down and dream about Utopia? Or are you going to take a gun and make a demonstration? In which case you won't in fact do any good, you'll probably do harm because the law and order reaction will make the situation still worse. Or are you going to see whether it might be possible to do some good in the immediate situation? I think the idea that reforms are hopeless and therefore the only thing is to wait for a revolution is is not a very useful point of view actually. Because I think if you demand reforms, you see, and the authorities have to admit your case. They have to admit your case, but they don't do anything about it. And that is already a step, you see, enabling you to challenge them. And so by raising the questions, you may do some good. I don't know. I mean, it's a problem for all of us.

**[Questioner 6]:** Do you think there is any likelihood of a revolution before the necessary reforms can be made in the West?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Do you?

**[Chairman]:** Further questions? Balcony again.

**[48:15] Questioner 7:** Yes, I'm somewhat concerned with your answer to the question of "too little food or too many people" because I think a great number of studies, particularly the United Nations Food and Agricultural Commission, have shown that we're already overusing the land. And most of our great areas of farming, the ones that produce most of our food now, are not going to be able be capable of producing that food in in the future. And that as close as perhaps 20 years from now, all of our marginal land will have to be used in intensive production of food. Now, in your answer to that question you seem to imply that our population could go on increasing without, you know, without really overtaxing the system. Would you like to just propose how far you think we can go in in that direction? Producing more food by efficient techniques and allowing more population to live?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, take the situation in India today. You see, they had a drought in parts of the country. In '73, they had a famine and they had relief works and got somehow through it. And then they had a very good monsoon. They had very good crops. But the distribution system didn't work. They had to run to the Soviets and get two million tons of wheat just to keep the food distribution in the cities going. Now this is not a technical problem, but a political problem. But the food is there. The prices are being kept up and the food is being sold in the black market instead of being procured and used through the distribution system. This is a political problem and not a technical problem. Of course the growth of numbers is a tremendous evil. I absolutely agree. The situation in many countries has been made enormously worse by improvements. This again is a hideous moral problem. By wiping out malaria with DDTs and bringing in some other health measures, they've got the infant death rate down while keeping the same birth rate as before. And making some small efforts to disseminate birth control and so on. But as long as people are living in this absolutely hopeless kind of conditions, it isn't possible to get them to go in for family planning. As they're saying in China, they have family planning like anything. Every kind of method is being used and disseminated and big propaganda campaign. Not because they admit that they that growing numbers are an evil. If you speak in China about the population question, you always get first of all a little sermon about how the wealth of a country is its people and all that. But in fact, they're very anxious to get their rate of increase down because growing population is a big economic burden. If you have the investment that has to be made in the social services, in education, and in equipping people for production, of course is a is a big burden on the people who already exist if numbers are growing. And in those countries where they haven't even begun to start on the problem of developing the education and health system and development and so on, it's it's it's a heartbreaking problem because 20 years have gone by, 25 years have gone by, and the numbers are growing and they haven't yet begun. And where wherever they do begin, the burden will be all the greater because of this long neglect. So it's a it's a terrible problem. I mean, I absolutely agree with you that the growth of numbers is a is a dreadful question. But the hunger which exists now is much more a political than a than an economic problem.

**[Chairman]:** Further questions? If not, I have one that I would like to put to Professor Robinson. I know that you've been recently in China and had an opportunity to examine their planning system. And it seems to me that it would be interesting to hear your comments on the relative differences in the way in which the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China have handled the problem of seeking to meet consumer preferences. If indeed there is or at those moments when there is a desire to meet consumer preferences.

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, the Chinese have got a very clever way of of managing their consumer good industries. They work through a kind of state wholesaling system. You're not talking about the agriculture and the management of the crops? I mean that's a very big question of course. But for minor agricultural, say vegetables and meat, eggs and fruit and so on... round each city, the agriculture is organized in communes—I suppose people know something about China, I don't want me to start from the beginning to describe what a commune is—but anyway, the the city authorities... of course all trade and manufactures, except the manufactures done in the communes, is in the state system. And the communes are a cooperative system. But the the state procurement apparatus in the city, see, places orders... places contracts with surrounding communes for vegetables. And they they have a kind of wholesale contract. And then it is broken down into direct contacts between each shop or street corner stall and the team—which is the basic unit in the communes which is producing the vegetables—that they are responsible for bringing it in. So you have the vegetables are brought in fresh every morning to where they're going to be sold. But the whole scheme is arranged, the wholesaling so to say is done between the commune and the city procurement authorities.

Or similarly with light industries, say textiles. The contracts are placed with the with the producer and with the shops. And so the shops are keeping informing the wholesale agency—which is run by the state procurement system—what people are buying, what's going fast, what people don't like so much. And with light industry you don't need such very long runs. I mean, perhaps three months. You can change the contract. And so keep the supply in touch with demand. Now the contract specifies the design, quality, delivery dates, and price of all the goods. So that the producer hasn't got to worry at all about any commercial relations. Just got to produce what's demanded in the contract as efficiently as possible and keep good morale in the factory. They they're concerned only with production and they don't have to bother about selling. And this of course is an is a very great benefit to the producers. The headache of trying to sell your goods is not present at all in this system.

Now, over and above working through the contracts, the particular producers like to keep in touch with their customers, with the consumers, and find out their views. For instance, a textile factory or furniture factory, something like that, will send workers and cadres—as they call them, the managers and technicians—to go and serve at the counter in a department store where their goods are being sold. And then they discuss it with the customers and find out what they think about it. They send missions into the country because they have shops in all the in all the villages. They are nominally under the supply and marketing cooperative, but actually they've now been absorbed into this same commercial system. They send people to the country and find out, for instance, whether the boots are strong enough for country wear. And they make different kind of boots for people to wear in town from what they wear in the fields and so on. So they they keep in touch with their customers and find out what they want.

And the the shop people, for instance the grocery stores or these vegetable stores, they find out whether there are some old people in their in their district who can't come to the shop. And then they'll take the order to the house or arrange for somebody to take it to the house and so on. They have tremendous feeling of, as they use the phrase, "serve the people." The shop assistant can serve the people in this way. They have a much higher level of consumer sovereignty than exists in any other system. Certainly more than exists here or more than exists in the Soviet Union.

**[Chairman]:** Any further questions? Your last time to ask any question on any subject and I'm sure you'll get a wise answer. If not, have one more up there, okay.

**[58:22] Questioner 8:** I'll try and get the mic right this time. You mentioned last time that you, like so many other people, see the British... the current British economic situation as rather disastrous. But tonight you did indicate your faith in the possibility of some efficable reforms. If you were the economic advisor to Harold Wilson right now, what sort of economic program would you advise him to put forward?

**[Chairman]:** Fair question.

**[Joan Robinson]:** I don't think he'd ask me.

**[Laughter]**

**[Joan Robinson]:** No, I mean the the British economy has got into an absolutely ghastly mess. And I think Wilson will try and extract himself as best he may in this situation. It isn't a situation in which it would be possible to go to any radical radical changes. You see, we always have a proverb in economics about the man who was driving and he came to a crossroads and he stopped and asked a chap there, "Which was the road for Oklahoma?" The man said, "If I was going to Oklahoma, I wouldn't start from here."

**[Laughter/Applause]**

**[59:58] Questioner 9:** Yes, Professor Robinson. When you were discussing the China, you were mentioning the the distribution system. My interest or my point or possibly my question is: What is our overall effect that we have in our commercial system because of the television commercials, the radio commercials? It's sort of an advertisement that induces you to buy something that is not necessarily useful but a status and/or sex symbol of some form. Is that part of our problem?

**[Joan Robinson]:** What did he say?

**[Chairman]:** Is that part of our problem, the preferences we have are induced in us by television commercials, newspaper advertisement, publicity and so on? And how do we handle that?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Yes. Well, one thing you certainly ought to do is bring up your children not to believe the advertisements.

**[Applause]**

**[Joan Robinson]:** I think that the the it's a very insidious way of catching the children. And then they beg Mommy to buy this or that. Well, you ought to have a very strong educational drive in the home to debunk advertisements so that children won't believe them. And then the more a thing is advertised, the less people will buy it. And then the whole position will be changed quite a bit.

**[1:01:58] Chairman:** I think that Professor Robinson has had a very, I would imagine, a very exhausting three days. Although she doesn't look it, I must confess. And rather than try to thank her in any way, all I can say is that she has really represented the Cantabrigian whirlwind that has swept through this campus. I know from looking at her itinerary on campus that she spoke to biologists, MacArthur School of Education, political scientists, urban... urbanologists and regionalists, and not to say economists. The most that I can say, at least in my personal contact with her and listening to her as well, is she's been... she has been a really great experience. Thank you.

**[Applause]**
