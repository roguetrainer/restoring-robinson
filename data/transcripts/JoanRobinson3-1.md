# **Summary: The Blight of Conventional Economics in the Third World**

In this lecture, Joan Robinson delivers a scathing critique of the application of orthodox neoclassical economics to the problems of developing nations ("The Third World"). She argues that while this theory is merely "useless" for solving the problems of the industrial West (like stagflation), it is actively "pernicious" when exported to developing countries.

### **Key Themes**

* **Tribute to Paul Baran:** The lecture begins with a tribute to Paul Baran, a former Stanford professor and Marxist economist, whom Robinson praises for maintaining his intellectual integrity during the McCarthy era. She cites his work, *The Political Economy of Growth*, as a foundational text for understanding underdevelopment.  
* **The "Pernicious" Nature of Orthodoxy:** Robinson argues that students from developing nations come to Western universities and are taught abstract mathematical models (like General Equilibrium) that have no connection to the reality of their own countries. This "miseducation" distracts them from the real problems of poverty, land reform, and industrialization.  
* **Critique of Free Trade:**  
  * She attacks the doctrine of Free Trade (Comparative Advantage) as a tool for maintaining the dominance of industrial nations.  
  * She revisits Ricardo's famous example of English cloth and Portuguese wine, noting the historical reality: the "free trade" treaty destroyed Portugal's textile industry and retarded its development, a fact ignored by standard textbooks.  
* **The "Transfer of Technology" Trap:**  
  * Robinson critiques the uncritical importation of Western technology.  
  * Western technology is designed for labor-scarce, capital-rich economies. When imported into labor-abundant, capital-poor countries, it creates "islands of high productivity" (a dual economy) without solving mass unemployment or poverty.  
  * She argues this benefits foreign corporations and a small local elite while leaving the masses behind.  
* **The Capital Controversy (Again):** She reiterates her critique of the "aggregate production function," arguing that one cannot measure capital as a physical quantity independent of distribution and prices. This renders the neoclassical explanation of profits (and thus development) logically incoherent.

### **Q\&A Highlights**

* **China vs. Other Models:** In the Q\&A, Robinson defends the Chinese model (of that time) against comparisons with countries like Brazil or Mexico, arguing that China prioritized the basic needs of the entire population over luxury consumption for a few.  
* **The Great Leap Forward:** When challenged about the failures and famine associated with the Great Leap Forward, Robinson attributes the difficulties primarily to three years of "disastrous weather" rather than systemic failure, a view that was common among some Western sympathizers at the time but has been heavily revised by later historical evidence.

# **Transcript**

**Introducer:** Good evening. I want to say a few words about Paul Baran, a former teacher here at Stanford who died almost exactly ten years ago... last March 29th.

I would like to thank Professor Gurley for his kind introduction. In his usual modest way, he has refused to say that he is carrying on some of the important work that Paul Baran has done.

His paper entitled "The New Man in the New China" has established some theoretical basis for analysis as an alternative analysis to neoclassical economics, using China as the empirical framework. Professor Gurley is also Vice President of the American Economic Association... and for a professor teaching Marxian economics at Stanford to be elected as Vice President of the American Economic Association is an achievement of no mean task.

*\[Applause\]*

My main task this evening is to introduce Professor Joan Robinson, who will speak on the topic: "The Blight of Conventional Economics in the Third World."

The second task is to briefly stage the stage... is to briefly set the stage for her speech and also to briefly comment on what took place this afternoon.

Paul Baran is an intellectual in the real sense of the word... or the word. He looked at the world of the underdeveloped countries and he theorized about it. Strangely enough, most of his work was done on the Stanford campus. But his work had more effects... far-reaching effects... across the Stanford campus.

This afternoon, Professor Drake analyzed how Baran's work found its way into Ghana... and was used during the revolutionary stage of the Nkrumah regime.

Jack Gurley this afternoon also explained the contributions of Baran to the 1950s. And also pointed out the limitations which Baran had in terms of not knowing too much about China... or that China hadn't matured to the stage in which it could be analyzed as of 1948\.

Professor Donald Harris also pointed out the descriptive nature of Baran's work and its perhaps lack of analytical content. Whereas Peter Sen also pointed out that in fact Baran's work had a lot of analytical content. It was also pointed out that Baran's work set the stage for present work of the Third World economics... entitled the Dependency School of Thought.

Now let me switch on and say one or two things about Professor Joan Robinson before making the formal introduction.

I first met her... uh... was a student in Berkeley. And I was a friend of a cousin of hers. And when she was in Berkeley, she asked her to take her to Mendocino, which we did. And we wanted to take a hike. So we started out the trail. And we wanted to be nice to her, so we decided to run up and then run down while she kept on walking.

But it was soon apparent that our running up and down was either making us tired or her pace was much faster than we thought. And she kept a steady pace which she never reduced. And in fact she tired us out. Because later on I found out that she takes long walks in Cambridge... and as a matter of experience she put challenges to walking any trail that we could.

Yesterday we went to Mendocino... in the morning... visited a cousin who lives in the woods. And we spent four hours last night discussing Christianity. And she was much at home... although the cousin is an economist... we didn't talk economics last night. But four hours on religion. And she was at home with the concepts of the Pentecost and and everything else.

So I would like to point out that Professor Joan Robinson is a very erudite woman.

She is important to the Third World for a very specific reason. The reason being that she makes neoclassical economists very insecure.

*\[Applause\]*

She developed the theory of Imperfect Competition... but has repudiated parts of it. And I take it to be the sign of intellectuality.

I would like to quote one or two sentences from a passage here which points out that neoclassical economics is not concomitant with the historical facts.

Karl Marx, in describing the way that the Third World developed, had this to say: "The discoveries of gold and silver in America, the extirpation of the indigenes in some instances, their enslavement or their entombment in the mines in the Indies, the transformation of Africa into a preserve for the supply of the negroes who were the raw materials of the slave trade... these were the incidents that characterized the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production. These were the idyllic processes that formed the chief factors of primary accumulation."

However, neoclassical economics does not take these historical facts into account in analyzing neoclassical economics.

In 1865, a traveler in the then Gold Coast, now Ghana, had this to say: "If we come to the interior six days' journey, people make iron and make their own clothes. But nobody thinks along the coast of making iron or clothes. Native industry disappears as far as the European trade is born."

Thus, under the era of Western capitalist expansionism and the era of international or colonial division of labor, the Third World countries underwent some structural transformations. And these transformations are not taken into account in analyzing neoclassical economics.

It is in this light that Professor Joan Robinson is going to talk to us about "The Blight of Conventional Economics in the Third World." She has written several books, among them *The Accumulation of Capital*, *Essays in Marxian Economics*, *The Economics of Imperfect Competition*, *Introduction to the Theory of Employment*, *Exercises in Economic Analysis*, and lately she has been writing chiefly on China.

And working in the Third World, I welcome Professor Joan Robinson very much to talk on this subject and to increase our insights into the problems of the Third World. Thank you.

*\[Applause\]*

**Joan Robinson:** Thank you very much indeed...

I touch at being asked to take part in this celebration of Paul Baran's work.

I regarded him as a very valuable person. I didn't generally agree with his theories; I used to argue with him a great deal. And he generally didn't take any notice of the criticisms I made. \[Laughter\] came out the same after our discussion.

But it was enormously valuable to have someone in the academic world in the United States who would stick to his opinions... who would not be frightened into conformity... and who kept alive an argument.

During all the time of the Cold War, the McCarthy period, he was always here and never allowed himself to be intimidated. And threw out suggestions which all over the world were accepted as showing that there was another side to the story of orthodox neoclassical economics.

This orthodox economics... is becoming more and more widely recognized that for the problems of the world really... problems of the industrial world... it is completely useless.

But from the point of view of the problems of the Third World, it is pernicious.

First of all, a great number of very brilliant students are caught in the Third World countries and distracted from taking any interest in the problems of their own countries... and taught to play these tricks with production functions and and... all the fiddles and faddles of so-called mathematical economics.

It's not mathematical as a matter of fact. It's merely fantastical. \[Laughter/Applause\]

I mean you can't do mathematical operations on a quantity unless you can say: "What is the quantity of?" You must define the unit. And the unit must imply its method of measurement.

When you are doing mathematical operations on Utility, or Capital, or even National Income... you're not doing mathematical operations at all because you haven't defined the unit and you haven't specified its method of measurement.

So it's pseudo-mathematics. But it's very very fascinating of course. And to high-level people it's very enjoyable to be able to show off doing it.

So here are people coming from countries where the economic problems are oppressive... serious... and need to be understood. And they are taken away and taught to play these idle games. That's one element of the problem.

But the more important element is that the doctrines which emanate from the neoclassical scheme are taught and made to influence policy in those countries.

You might say it doesn't really matter what the economists say, the policies would be the same anyway. But I don't think this is entirely true because there is an important influence in the... the intellectual elite in these countries... there is an important influence in the formation of policy. And the fact that they are continually being taught doctrines which are totally inapplicable to their problems is certainly harmful... not merely adding a respectable surface to what would have been done anyway.

The most obvious case of this is the doctrine of Free Trade. Free Trade was the central core... the Ark of the Covenant... of the old neoclassical economics... the pre-Keynesian system. The hallmark of an economist was someone who understood that protection is harmful to all... in all circumstances.

But this doctrine in the West has become very much attenuated. Keynes pointed out for instance that... protection would increase employment for one country in a situation of slump... although it would do so only at the expense of making the slump worse somewhere else.

But this doctrine is still very powerful. The theoretical basis of it is very narrow. It was derived from the case against protection which Ricardo made. And he took the example, you remember, of Portugal exporting wine and England exporting cloth. And he showed how the doctrine of comparative advantages taught that it would be a good thing for Portugal to give up protecting its textile industry and for England to give up protecting its wine industry.

And he gives a nice little example and shows that this follows from the assumptions. The assumptions are in terms of static comparison.

There's a very interesting book has been written about what actually happened in the trade between England and Portugal. The result of removing protection meant that the textile industry in Portugal came to an end. The textile industry in Great Britain flourished. In England the development of the textile exports led on to the whole process of the Industrial Revolution. And the development of export of port from Portugal led to a very stagnant development of their economy.

Now... you know in the textbooks now... you don't even have Ricardo with cloth and wine. You have two countries and two commodities. And the countries are all exactly alike. There's no difference in their comparative advantages. The only difference is in the endowment of the factors of production. And so in this way they've reduced the argument to a state in which it is completely vacuous. Because even less is to be said for it than Ricardo's example.

But to preach to countries in the Third World that they ought to develop their export of their natural resources and not try to foster industry... of course is a rather convenient doctrine for the already developed industrial countries which want to have a ready access to the supplies of materials and to the markets of these countries.

So... the countries in fact of course realized that it's quite impossible for them to develop at all if they don't protect their industries. And develop import substitution as a basis for development and so on. But they're made to feel guilty about it. And when they get into trouble with the balance of payments... which of course frequently happens... the IMF comes along and imposes upon them this policy of free trade and exchange depreciation as a way of getting out of their difficulties.

Now it's very transparent who gains from imposing this policy upon the Third World countries.

What actually happens with protection is illustrated by the story of this same industry, the British cotton textiles. The British cotton textile industry developed in the first place under protection against the goods which were being imported from India. Because the Indian muslins were much superior to anything that could be produced in England.

But then the Lancashire industry got through its teething troubles and began to produce successfully. And then... didn't any longer need protection. And the Indian market was thrown open. And India was not allowed to protect her industry. The British government in India imposed Free Trade. And they believed in it to such an extent that even at a later stage when the government of India had some fiscal autonomy... and they imposed a tariff on piece goods simply to get revenue... and then they were obliged to put an equal excise duty on home-produced cotton so as to be fair and not to give them any protection.

Now this system first of all of imports from Lancashire... and secondly from some development of industrial manufactures within India... had the effect of wiping out practically entirely their indigenous handloom industry. Not quite true because at a later stage the industry somewhat revived on importing yarn... because the advantage in spinning of mechanical methods of production is much greater than weaving. The hand spinning disappeared but weaving revived somewhat at a later stage.

The argument was used... in fact I think I was told this when I was reading for the Tripos in the 20s... that it's obviously the case that if the Indian public are buying the imported cotton in preference to their own indigenous production, it must be because they prefer it. And therefore they are benefiting from having the open market and being able to buy the cotton piece goods from Lancashire.

Now it's important I think to analyze this argument. Because superficially it seems quite plausible. If you have free trade, the manufactured goods can undersell the handmade goods and the people want to buy them... well... they ought to be allowed to buy them.

But looking at it from the point of view of the Indian economy... see... the advantage to the consumer is a little bit extra. The preference of the foreign goods over the home-produced goods is something extra. They prefer these goods or they are cheaper and so they have an advantage. But they have to pay the price of the whole cost of goods. So that the handloom industry which has disappeared is a loss to the nation. And the gain is only just that little bit extra of the preference for the imported goods.

But this way of looking at the matter of course is not allowed to penetrate the textbook arguments about consumer's choice and the benefits of free trade.

Now I think another very important confusion which is fostered by economic teaching... and that is the idea that Capital is a Factor of Production.

And what is necessary for development... for industrialization... is to have more Capital. And if the foreigners come in and make investments in the country... or if governments give loans... then the would-be developing country is getting some capital. It's getting a Factor of Production. And it ought to be very grateful to the dear kind capitalists who are giving them this Factor of Production.

Now what is the process of importing capital in this sense? What you import is finance.

You have a loan... it's money. It's loans which have been given.

And this means that it's possible to have a deficit on the balance of payments... without going bankrupt.

This is what getting finance means. It enables you to pay for some imports but you are not able to pay for with the proceeds of exports.

Now... supposing that this were taken in the case of a direct investment. The foreign company is going to open a branch to exploit the market in this Third World country. And so they first of all are providing some finance.

But generally they don't provide finance equal to the whole cost of the investment. Because in many of these countries have now reached a level of development where they have a capital market of their own. So the foreign company can put in a little finance and then borrow by selling bonds in the local market. So the country doesn't even get the whole amount in terms of finance.

Now this will partly be used to import ingredients which go into the investment. There's some machinery which can't be made in the country... it hasn't got its own iron and steel industry... it has to import steel and so on. So part of the cost of the investment will be for imports.

Now... the investment is a real investment... if you're importing physical ingredients which are going to go into the investment... this is a real investment.

But the greater part of the investment of course must be made by labor locally. All the digging and construction work will have to be done by the local labor.

Now this is not being used... the finance is not being used to bring in something which the country hasn't got. It's being used to organize the employment of labor on the spot. And this employment is then creating the installation... the instruments of production... the factory... whatever it may be... is being created by labor. And the foreign capital that's coming in is merely a subscription to the import surplus of the country.

Now the import surplus is not needed for supplying this investment which must be done locally. And therefore it's becoming available for importing other goods. And what goods are being imported? They'll be generally speaking the luxury consumption goods which are not forming an ingredient in development of the country at all. On the contrary are rather a drag on investment on development because once the wealthy class in the country gets a taste for foreign goods... this is going to reduce the resources available for investment.

Now here you see... a factory say has been created... some employment is given... labor is given... and some goods are being turned out and being sold... and some profits are being made by the factory.

And the capital investment which has gone into setting this business up is then belonging to the equity holders abroad. And the profits can then be remitted.

So that this little bit of finance that you've had... has been made available to the country... has created a large amount of earning resources which then are obliged to remit profits.

Now supposing the business is successful... making profits out of the home market by employing the home labor... you succeed in getting some more profits and the business is expanding. Well that's alright... now they're creating more resources in the country and employing more labor... that's fine.

But then all this extra capital which has been created out of the profits earned in this market and by the labor of the people on the spot... this again is capital which belongs to the equity holder abroad and which has to have profits remitted.

So this is the process of importing capital. And the economics textbooks which muddle up the concept of capital meaning factories and machinery... with capital meaning finance... are helping to promote this confusion... and keep the people in the country in ignorance of what it is that's really happening.

Now... this is... the whole problem of time... is this Arrow-Debreu game is another way... like putty capital... of getting away from the problem of time.

$$Joan Robinson continues to critique the timeless nature of neoclassical models, arguing that they cannot address issues of development, accumulation, and historical change. She touches on the "reswitching" controversy again, emphasizing that without a coherent theory of profits and capital, neoclassical economics is intellectually bankrupt.$$  
**Q\&A Session**

**Question:** You mentioned China as an example for development. It seems that in many ways China is unique and not really... does not really characterize most of the less developed countries. I mean it has a large internal market... it has most of the resources necessary for development. Um... it seems like for a... for the vast majority of LDCs... development for them has to come through... you know... expanded trade... not not... self-sufficiency... self-sufficiency as China has achieved... is achieving development.

**Robinson:** Well... those two countries that you mentioned \[referring to a previous unrecorded comment, likely about Brazil or Mexico\]... are very unlike China in the purpose to which they are putting their development. Because in China the object of the development is to raise the standard of life and education and capacity to produce of everybody in the country. And to to maintain a very simple level of consumption until everybody is able to enjoy whatever luxuries there may be.

Whereas both in Mexico and Brazil... there's a complete polarization of consumption. You have a a small luxury class... and a very large miserable class. So that although the policy has been quite clever in capitalist terms... the object is very different from the object of China.

**Question:** What would you say then are the effects of a... foreign capitalized export industry such as petroleum... such as petroleum.

**Robinson:** Well... those people are doing fairly well just at the moment. *\[Laughter\]*

**Question:** I think there's another model very similar to China and that's the case of... well two models actually... Mexico and Brazil. And I think especially Mexico... they've proceeded fairly well along the import substitution... uh... policies which you are preaching I believe. And uh... today they seem to be fairly self-sufficient in many areas. And I think that's another model which is going to grow in the future years.

**Robinson:** Well... those two countries that you mentioned... are very unlike China in the purpose to which they are putting their development. Because in China the object of the development is to raise the standard of life and education and capacity to produce of everybody in the country. And to to maintain a very simple level of consumption until everybody is able to enjoy whatever luxuries there may be.

Whereas both in Mexico and Brazil... there's a complete polarization of consumption. You have a a small luxury class... and a very large miserable class. So that although the policy has been quite clever in capitalist terms... the object is very different from the object of China.

**Question:** ...about the Great Leap Forward... wasn't fall in output...

**Robinson:** No... I don't follow your argument at all. What output has fallen?

**Questioner:** As I understand it there was a famine in China in '62 and '63 following the Great Leap Forward.

**Robinson:** Well... the story of the Great Leap Forward was that it was followed by three very bad years of very disastrous weather conditions. Now the Chinese... they had harvest failures...

**Questioner:** \[Inaudible interruption\]

**Robinson:** ...we can stop...

*\[Audio cuts out\]*
