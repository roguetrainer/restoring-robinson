**[00:00] Chairman:** ...in the hope that the inspiration of Chancellor Dunning's life of public service would help future students to do their part in service to the community. The memorial took the form of a handsome endowment so that its income might be expended, and I quote, "to promote understanding and appreciation of the supreme importance of the dignity, freedom, and responsibility of the individual person in human society."

A visiting lectureship has been selected as the best means to fulfill the intent of the trust. And it's been the good fortune of Queen's University to benefit from the wisdom of many outstanding visitors. While specialists in quite different disciplines of study, Dunning Trust lecturers have been able to throw light on many topics of general interest to university people.

It is a just but sobering comment of our times that recent Dunning Trust lecturers have expressed concern about the erosion of the understanding and appreciation of the importance of the individual in human society. Now, this year, the concern—this same concern—broadens as we turn our attention to the subject of growth. Growth and development: the mythology of growth.

In this area of general concern, we have a distinguished woman, a woman economist, to address us this evening. And I'm confident that we will not be disappointed. I've just had dinner with her; she’s charming and she's got a wonderful spirit. Now, let me tell you something about Mrs. Joan V. Robinson. [French phrase: *Il n'y a pas de double entente*] intended there.

Professor Robinson has been in the vanguard among economists for more than four decades. Her classic, *The Economics of Imperfect Competition*, published in 1933, by itself would have ensured her an enduring place in her profession. But it was only the beginning. She went on to make major contributions in the theory of employment, in the theory of capital and growth, and in many other areas.

At the same time, her indirect contributions to economics through her participation in the ferment of thought at Cambridge throughout her life—and she still lives at Cambridge—and through her teaching in the University of Cambridge, have been significant. Her work has not ended; books and articles of distinction are still coming from her pen. Professor Robinson was made a Fellow of the British Academy in 1958. And she and her husband have two daughters, and I learned that they have five grandchildren. And one of those daughters and two of the grandchildren live in Ontario.

Now, the subject of Professor Robinson's Dunning Lectures is, as you know from the notice, "The Mythology of Growth." And it's divided into two parts. Tonight, she begins with "Growth and the Economists." And two days from now, Wednesday at 8:00 PM in this hall, she will continue with "Doomsday is Today." And after her formal presentation, she has kindly agreed to receive questions and commentary from the audience. And it's for this reason that there is a microphone placed in the aisle.

I give you Mrs. Robinson.

**[Applause]**

**[04:22] Joan Robinson:** Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your kind welcome. I'd like first of all to know if we're all right for sound. Can the people at the back hear all right? I don't need the light because I haven't any notes... [Adjusts microphone/light]. Thank you.

Well, I think that on the whole, and with a few noted exceptions, the economists have been on the side of growth. In the debate which is now going on, the alarm has been raised by the natural scientists rather than the economists. The view of the planet as a spaceship, the view of the Earth as a living space for the human race which is rapidly being devoured, has not come from the economists. And the economists have been, on the whole, on the other side of the question. And they're still telling us that you really needn't worry, that the price system will look after it, and so on.

But this is very recent. The economics in which I was brought up—that was in the 20s—the question of growth really hardly arose. In fact, the argument was nearly all conducted in terms of stationary states. And the main topic was the allocation of *given* resources between alternative uses.

Well, in the Great Slump, the problem wasn't the allocation of scarce resources between alternative uses, but to get the resources in existence to be used. And the argument that went on at that time was about how to cure the slump, how to prevent unemployment. And the orthodox economists of those days were saying that it wasn't necessary to do anything about it, that equilibrium would be restored in due course, that the only cause of unemployment was the stupid obstinacy of the trade unions in refusing wages to be cut, and so on.

Now, I myself took part in that argument in the early days of what became known as the Keynesian Revolution. And the emphasis was entirely on this question of how to be able to make use of the resources we've got. And the question of growth was not yet over the horizon.

The emphasis in the Keynes theory was on under-consumption. The problem was insufficient demand for the resources already in existence. A tendency to save more than it was possible to invest at a profit. So that saving was regarded in Keynes' theory as a vice. This was the big reversal. And what people found most shocking in Keynes' theory—because what to you is now perfectly orthodox and perhaps even retrograde, was at that time very subversive and shocking to orthodox opinion. And what was most shocking was that Keynes said that saving was causing unemployment, which was the way of putting it in terms of an under-consumption situation. Saving had always been the greatest of all economic virtues, and here was Keynes saying that spending money would do more good than saving.

When Alvin Hansen brought the message to the United States, it was in terms of under-consumption. You remember the old thing that the slump was caused by the closing of the frontier? There was no further outlet for savings. There was a very big difference in the way Keynes looked at it and the way Alvin Hansen was putting it. For Alvin Hansen, it was a horror story. You see, capitalism generates saving, and with the slowing down of population growth, closing of the frontier, there’ll be no outlet for saving, and this will be a threat to capitalism.

But Keynes saw it the other way around. He thought that the need for investment would come to an end. If we could run an economy with the amount of investment that would be required to maintain full employment for 30 years, the economic problem would be solved. And then really civilized life could begin at last. And economists would look forward to a humble and useful function like dentists. [Laughter]

So, when... after the war, growth theory became a fashionable subject. It was opened up by Roy Harrod, his book *Towards a Dynamic Economics*. He was putting the problem, again, in terms of under-consumption, of excess saving. The problem which he foresaw, he put in his funny language as being an excess of the warranted rate of growth over the natural rate. The natural rate is the rate of growth which would keep up with the rate of growth of population and technical progress. And the warranted rate would be the rate which would be required to absorb saving. And if the warranted rate exceeds the natural rate, we shall have chronic slumpy conditions. Again, a concept of too much saving for useful investment.

Well, these ideas, of course, now seem very funny. But I want to emphasize that the economists didn't start on this growth line until the subject had become a fashionable one in terms of policy. Now, why did the growth question come into the forefront after the war, after 1945?

Well, the first reason I think that it emerged naturally from the new conception—sometimes called Keynesian, but it wasn't really... Keynes isn't to be blamed for it—the conception that governments could maintain employment by running budget deficits. And the new policy came into fashion, and this immediately led on to a problem of accumulation of something or other, because how were you to keep the economy running at near full employment without a continuous accumulation emerging?

So it came naturally out of the situation. But I think that there was a big political reason behind it. And that was that after the war, the capitalist nations were very, very conscious of the rivalry with the Soviet Union. Because now we've heard all the horrors about Stalin and the Soviet Union has fallen behind technologically and so on, and the idea of the Soviet Union as a menace is quite out of date. I mean, a menace in the sense of a tremendous appeal to the workers of the Western world. But at that time, the capitalist nations were very conscious of the fact that if they went back into the pre-war situation of slump and unemployment, their workers simply wouldn't stand for it, now that they had the example of a country in which full employment and growth appeared to be maintained.

And within the capitalist world, there was rivalry between the Western nations. And gradually this comparison of nations in terms of growth came into fashion. As a colleague of mine, Alec Cairncross, began by mocking at this. The OECD and the United Nations and so on would be publishing figures comparing different nations in respect to their growth of GDP and the savings ratio, the amount of investment, and so forth. And he was mocking at this as the "League Tables."

Because the UK always came at the bottom. The United States and Canada were quite low, but the UK was at the bottom. And very soon after the reconstruction period, West Germany was near the top, and Japan, of course, again after a period of reconstruction, shot ahead and became the leading growth nation.

And the situation of the UK was very serious. And of course, it’s got steadily worse until the situation we're in at the present time is really extremely bad. But the problem of growth therefore appeared in this form: appeared in the form of the rivalry between nations, of the rivalry in trade, the envy of West Germany where they had continually strong balance of payments, rapid growth, rising real wages which made it possible for them to mitigate the rise in money wages which was causing inflation in the United Kingdom, and so on.

So, here were the... here was the setting in the real world of growth becoming the most fashionable topic. So the economists began to take it up. But the Keynes doctrine, meanwhile, had been taken over into the United States and emasculated and turned back into a version of the old laissez-faire theory, theory of allocation of scarce means between alternative uses and all that. I mean, you know that very well, those of you who are studying economics, because you're submitted here in Canada to the same kind of teaching. And so for that matter is nearly everybody else.

Well, the version of growth theory which emerged from the orthodox theory was still emphasizing saving. And the conception is that society decides how much to save, and these savings get invested. And as investment goes on relative to the growth of the labor force, you get a rise in capital per man and a rise in output per head. And we must regard saving as a sacrifice which the present generation undertakes in order to enjoy a higher income in the future. This is the way the problem is looked at.

But this is a way of looking at an economy which is making it on the analogy of a peasant family or a cooperative like a kibbutz. To say the people who have some land, they have whatever resources they've accumulated, the means of production they've accumulated, and they decide whether to put their energies into producing for current consumption or putting their work and resources into, say, draining a marsh or growing, enlarging their herd of animals, whatever it may be. So here you've got an economy in which the idea of a choice between present consumption and accumulation in order to increase future income is cogent. It fits the facts.

And this is the kind of conception which the orthodox economists are putting on the problem of growth in the capitalist nations. The same ideas were being exported to the ex-colonial countries which we now call the Third World.

Now, the question is, what is it growth *of*? Do you think it's a very strange use of language to talk about growth without saying *what* is growing? How can you have growth as a concept in itself?

The economists don't like to have to say *what* it is that's growing. [Laughter] Because the idea in economics—first of all, that production is for the purpose of consumption. And consumption contributes to welfare. Well, what is supposed to be growing is the welfare of the population. That's the basic idea, or rather not the idea, but the ideology, the defense of the concept of growth is put in those terms.

Now, what is the connection between welfare and statistical national income? You see, it's rather a wide step from the concept of welfare to the concept of statistical measure in dollars of national income. Now, this is a point then which doesn't get very much discussed. But statistical national income is measuring flows of money payments. These money payments correspond to flows of production. And the money stands for the physical production.

Now, what's called consumption in national income figures doesn't mean people consuming goods. It means people *purchasing* goods. It's the flow of goods being sold which is the measure of consumption. And then consumption is the measure of welfare, and so there you are. You step from statistical national income to the growth of welfare.

Now, *whose* welfare? Of course, it's well known that income is not equally distributed. And the economists have always conceded, or even emphasized, that if you give a dollar to a poor man who can hardly feed his children, he gets more welfare out of it than if you take the dollar away from a millionaire who won't notice it. If you put it in that very extreme form, of course, it's quite harmless. But actually, it plays all along the line.

So, they have to get over this problem, and they do this by comparing the nations in terms of income per capita. The nations are compared by income per capita in dollars, or the growth of income per capita is calculated for any one nation, and this is the measure of growth. And growth means purchases, and purchases mean consumption, and consumption means welfare.

So, this is the way it goes. Now, for a long time in the canon of economics has been admitted the pollution problem. Professor Pigou used to call—used to take the example of the smoke nuisance. Of course, the smoke nuisance was a rather mild example of pollution compared to what we're used to nowadays. So even the economists have to recognize that there are some negative elements which ought to be allowed for when you're calculating national income.

I mentioned that Japan was standing at the top of the League Tables. I'm talking about the period from say 1950 to 1971. I mean, we're now living in a new era and a very confused and confusing era. Well, this great growth period was those 20 years. And Japan was heading the league. And the problem of pollution in Japan is so appalling that even economists have to notice it.

Now, the Japanese have now introduced the idea of calculating National Income Net—called National Welfare Income [Note: Likely Net National Welfare, NNW]. How do they do this? They calculate—to allow for the effects of pollution—calculate what the cost would be of removing this pollution. And then subtract *that* from the positive national income to arrive at the net welfare national income.

They don't actually *do* it, of course. They're not spending the money on stopping the pollution. That's quite another matter. It's a purely notional thing.

Well, here, you see, you're still thinking in terms of the money measure of positive or negative welfare. Supposing that you've... you're bringing up a child whose brain has been damaged by lead poisoning. Now, what are you going to put in as a negative item into GNP to make that come right? This whole way of doing the calculation is really not much advance on the idea of measuring welfare by national income in the first place.

But the economists are always saving their conscience by putting in reservations. You see, they teach you this doctrine about growth and welfare and all that, but they always save their conscience by putting in reservations. So they admit that purchases don't really measure consumption because purchases are strongly influenced by physical and psychological obsolescence of goods.

The consumption, or the amount of consumption you get out of spending ten dollars, of course, has a time dimension. It's how long the thing is going to be useful. If you're just eating your dinner, you don't expect it to last till next morning. But if you're buying a refrigerator or a motorcar or furniture, even clothes, the question of how long it's going to last, of course, is extremely important.

If you measure consumption by purchases, you leave that out altogether. But if you're trying to measure satisfaction or welfare by consumption, of course, there's another step in the argument. Because how much of what people choose to consume is foisted upon them, for instance, by advertisement? Or by fashion which is engineered in a subtle way? Not by crude advertisement, but by a general atmosphere of boosting consumption as the foundation of happiness? How much of the satisfaction that you get from your purchases is destroyed by finding that the Joneses have got a later model?

All these questions are allowed for. You see, you'll find them mentioning these facts. But it doesn't in any way destroy the main burden of the song, which is that growth of national income means growth of consumption, and growth of consumption means growth of welfare.

Now, how could you possibly for a moment swallow a theory like that? Particularly if you're living now in this age. How much welfare in being able to go and swim—for the kids to be able to go and swim in a stream? That's not possible now. Not safe. So that ought to be subtracted from welfare. How about the size of cities which compels people to have motorcars and therefore compels them to burn up petrol... I'm sorry, gas... and then they have to have a second car because the wife is left at home and she'll get hipped if she hasn't got a car. And so you've got this extraordinary proliferation of what we call our standard of life which is generated by the negative elements in the national income.

How could you possibly swallow such a theory that purchases represent consumption and consumption represents welfare when what's put in is only those things that you buy with money, and all the free goods are left out? Now, this is what they expect people to swallow.

Now, how could it come about that a whole profession of very clever—because you must admit they're very clever, very clever and very expensively educated people—could be putting forward views like this?

Well, when you find a doctrine which seems on the face of it absurd, and when you poke it and it still seems absurd, then you must look for the explanation. And the explanation lies, I think, in the fact that the profession of economics exists on two levels. On one level, it's an endeavor to develop scientific examination of economic life. And on the other level, it's a way of emitting a particular ideology.

Now, the ideology which is required by modern commercial civilization is the idea that precisely selling goods is the most beneficial element in economic life. The idea that accumulation comes about as result of saving, of the decisions of the householder to refrain from consumption in order to build up his income for the future. This isn't an account of how saving actually takes place in a modern economy. For individual families, of course, who contribute to pension schemes and so forth, from the point of view of the individual, it's quite true, saving is for future consumption.

But the way saving takes place in the large is through the retention of profits by businesses. Now, I think this was just as true for the old-fashioned family business which, uh, Marshall describes. In a recent book, Kenneth Galbraith tries to make a distinction between what he calls the market economy where there are small businesses and they are competitive and they are all right, and then you have the big businesses which are monopolies and exercise power.

I don't think that this distinction really is quite as valid as seems on the surface because the small businesses, if they're successful, will grow. And this is an absolutely essential characteristic of the kind of economy that we're living in. That a business, if it's successful, is making profits and is keeping part of the profits to finance further investment.

You couldn't possibly imagine a business, even a small one, which was distributing its whole net profit. It would be a very un-business-like thing to do, to distribute the whole net profit and leave yourself just with the capital you started with. Obviously, for any prudent business will be keeping part of their net profit back, and then they will naturally use it to expand their own business rather than buying shares in somebody else's business. And so this business... growth of a business is an absolutely inherent and essential characteristic of the kind of society that we live in. And this is a very obvious fact again, which the orthodox school of economics tries to smother over with this concept of the virtuous family man saving for the benefit of his children or for his old age.

Well, this process of growth and accumulation has been going on for 200 years, if not more. And some businesses of course have failed; they're always dropping out of the game. But those which survive go on growing. So we have this development of the enormous institutions which are now managing the economy of all the Western world.

The process of growth was given a great boost by the development of limited liability. See, formerly, if you had to risk your money in a business and then you are liable for the debts of the business. The introduction of limited liability made it possible to have the modern kind of shareholder who just buys the paper that his broker advises him to buy. And he takes no risk except just for making a bad investment and losing that bit of his money. So he spreads his money around.

And so the *rentier*, the saver, the person who's handing over his savings to business to be invested, is not fully the owner of the business. See, legally the business is supposed to be owned by the shareholders. Legally the shareholders supposed to appoint the directors, and the directors appoint the manager. And then the spokesmen of industry say, "Of course, we have to look after the interests of our shareholders." They put forward a lot of pious talk about how they are serving their shareholders.

But actually, what happens is that the companies, if they are successful, are investing, developing, building new branches, and buying up companies all over the world, and amalgamating enormous large octopuses of capital with tentacles spreading into different countries and different industries. Another story is that the success of a business depends on economies of large scale, but of course, they are all over the place producing different commodities in different countries. And economies of large scale play a very minor part in the growth of these large accumulation of finance which the large businesses own.

Now, if they are successful, you see, and they are reinvesting out of their profits and growing, and this is creating more earning assets. And these earnings then drop into the lap of the shareholders because as the earning assets behind the share increase, the values of the share rise. And so that the most important thing which the brokers look out for when they're advising their clients is not the dividends but capital gains.

And so we've developed a very strange sort of society. Which the power and authority which manages employment, which decides on how the economy is to be run, which carries out this business of allocating scarce means between alternative uses—that is to say, in a high-consumption segment of a miserable country where American patterns of consumption and therefore patterns of technology are introduced into countries where the great mass of the people haven't got enough to eat. So that you get this development of countries, you see in Latin America and in Asia, which is divided—the population is divided—into those who have motorcars and those who haven't got shoes. And this is growth!

And you put it into income per head. When you put it into income per head, it doesn't really look very good because the growth of the number of heads in the barefooted part of the population is unfortunately very rapid, so that quite a big output per head and consumption per head in the modernized sector doesn't go very far. So that we find a rather miserable record of growth in per capita consumption in these countries.

But it's all growth. And this game of calculating in terms of national income per head, counting income in terms of purchases, treating purchases as consumption, and consumption as the basis of welfare, is the contribution of economics to this question. So that I think you'd very much better listen when the biologists come to speak to you rather than the economists.

**[Applause]**

**[34:55] Chairman:** Well, Professor Robinson, I think the rapt attendance, the full house, and the variety of questions is indicative of the deep interest your audience has in your subject. I think you've disturbed us all in our comfortable pew. I don't think there's any economists in Kingston will sleep tonight soundly.

**[Laughter]**

**[35:28] Chairman:** I wonder now if there are any questions from the audience? Because Professor Robinson has said she would be glad to answer them.

**[35:46] Questioner 1:** Would you care to name some names of the economists who have sort of propagated these doctrines?

**[Joan Robinson]:** You know them very well.

**[Laughter]**

**[Joan Robinson]:** They're in all the textbooks.

**[Laughter]**

**[Chairman]:** Would you like the authors of any of the textbooks to stand up?

**[Laughter]**

**[Chairman]:** I see people from the Business School here, and I'm surprised that there aren't some questions from them.

**[Laughter]**

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, as a matter of fact, I generally find people from the Business School easier to talk to than theoretical economists. I mean, they might have rather a different ideological slant from myself, but they do know a little bit about what goes on in the business world. [Laughter]

**[37:11] Questioner 2 (Man):** I think perhaps you're being a bit unfair, but mostly to me... [Laughter] ...most of the argument against not putting pollution in the national income statistics, which seem to be the result of the difficulty of measuring them. How do you actually measure this?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, because the thing can't be measured, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. And this is... this is exactly the sort of way that economists argue, you see. You can get statistics for national income in money terms. I mean, they're not very good statistics, but anyway you can get statistics of national income in money terms. So that's the only thing that matters. This is just how economists argue.

**[38:11] Questioner 3 (Man):** Why have so many people in this room been misled?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Why have so many people in this room been misled?

**[Questioner 3]:** Yes.

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, I'm sorry to hear they have been misled, but... [Laughter] It's to me a great mystery. It really is. It's a great mystery. And I'm constantly puzzling over it. How is it that generation after generation of generous-minded young students come in and then absorb this stuff?

I really don't understand how it happens because we've had, ever since the Keynesian Revolution, we've had an alternative approach. Perhaps... you know, it's kept out, you're not allowed to read those books. But anyway, you think it would... rumors about it would penetrate.

But I think it is that economics is a subject not like a science, but like theology. You see, if you're studying theology, you have to learn that particular set of dogmas. And you get your grades, and get your degree, and get your PhD by repeating those dogmas. And I think that is how it works.

**[39:53] Questioner 4:** Mrs. Robinson, you are rather pessimistic, I think, about the West extricating itself from this particular groove or rut. I think you suggest the Third World is bringing down the same type of groove. And as far as I can gather from you, you don't have much hope in the Third World redeeming the situation either. Now, you've written a book on *The Cultural Revolution in China*. I'm wondering whether you see any hope of an alternative to this way of thinking in what you encountered in your study of mainland, or the People's Republic of China.

**[Joan Robinson]:** Yes, please don't call it "Mainland China," that's out of date.

**[Laughter]**

**[Joan Robinson]:** Yes, certainly. I mean, the Chinese are showing how development *can* be tackled. And they're carrying out very important and interesting experiments. But they haven't got themselves into the clutches of the great multinational firms before they began. And how we are to extricate ourselves is a very, very difficult problem for us.

**[41:35] Questioner 5 (Man):** With respect to the question that the gentleman in front of me here raised a few moments ago as to how we are all misled as to the commercial ideology as you put it, which conventional economists are propagating. I'd like to submit this somewhat humbly conceived, conspiratorially minded view of, in fact, a political-industrial conspiracy which *requires* that we all be misled.

If you assume, and take this as an assumption, that certainly the technology must be available today to produce, for example, a permanent lasting razor blade, or a set of Dunlop tires that run 200,000 miles rather than 40,000 miles, or that cars could last for 30 years and so on, and that people employed in these industries could be freed of their trivial, menial kind of daily tasks and be freed and put into some kind of public-oriented kind of production. Take that as an assumption... that certainly the technology must be available.

And consider also that certainly the public revenue is forced to rely on personal income tax and corporate income tax as certainly the sources of revenue to employ people in public revenue-oriented kinds of tasks to produce public goods. Then I would submit that certainly the conspiracy must exist and must continue to exist. For by definition, if you were to invent that permanent razor blade, people are freed, but on the other hand, the corporation dissolves, goes into non-existence, and the corporate tax revenue on which the government formerly relied to employ people to produce public goods disappears. Consequently, the tax base shrinks. And it... it just has to persist. People have to be rooted in menial kind of employment that doesn't really produce any positive public good. I just bounce that off you.

**[Joan Robinson]:** No, I haven't really quite got your line of thought. But the... uh... you see, the workers are organized by these enterprises. And the workers are then committed to that line of production. You see, I couldn't imagine greater nonsense than using the resources of the UK, which is, as I say, economically in a very bad way, to make the Concorde. Well, having started on the Concorde, you see, it's now very difficult. Even we've got a Labour government which wants to reorient the economy. But the workers at Bristol are a big influence to be... keep the Concorde going so that they won't lose their jobs.

You see, there is such an enormous inertia once you've started on any kind of thing. And of course, the biggest example of this and the most tragic example of this is the American arms industry. See, after pretending to have stopped the Vietnam War—of course, it isn't stopped, it's still going on—but pretend that they've stopped the Vietnam War, and they're making a détente with the Soviet Union, and they still go on increasing the arms budget.

Wasn't there just such an enormous inertia behind all those people who are deriving their incomes and their self-respect, because they don't want to admit that their lives have been devoted to nothing but useless horror. All that, you see, is behind keeping it in this groove. It isn't only the profits of the big concerns, but also the livelihood of the workers and the self-respect of the scientists. So it's very, very difficult to reverse the situation once we've got so far.

**[45:15] Questioner 6:** I believe corporations are not altruistic. So they say if it's not profitable to the workers, they don't give money to them, nothing or very little. Who will give this brilliance... these corporations giving money to non-profitable works? How [inaudible]?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Who's to blame?

**[Questioner 6]:** No, I'm just asking if corporations are not altruistic...

**[Joan Robinson]:** No, I don't think anybody's to blame. Everybody does their stuff. You see, everybody does their stuff according to the rules of the game of their particular profession. I mean, if it may be inventing ways of blowing the world up, well that's what they're paid for. That they're doing it, you see? And the workers and the what Galbraith calls the technostructure and the top management, they're all doing their stuff. And they all have this need to keep the show going. There isn't any longer any pretense of anything except, we must keep the show going, otherwise we'll lose our jobs. That's the fix that we've got into.

**[46:42] Questioner 7:** Earlier in this afternoon you talked about the rules of the game. And it seems to me your discussion revolves something around the capitalist system, the system. Now would you suggest, say, two rules of the game that you would like to see changed to help us get out from this mess?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, someone quoted an epigram of mine the other day. I've forgotten where I said it, but I think it's very true: "The answer to all economic problems are political questions."

**[Questioner 8]:** You said that we ought to start listening to the biologists and begin cleaning things up. This sounds, you know, very sort of a nice idea. But given the economic system that you've described, how do we make cleaning things up *profitable* so that they'll happen?

**[Joan Robinson]:** How do we make cleaning up profitable... so that it will happen.

**[Questioner 8]:** Yes.

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, I'm sorry to say I don't know what to do. [Laughter] I really haven't got a simple solution to offer you. But it's up to you. It's you young people. You see, at my age, you always think the world's going to the dogs. Well, perhaps this time it's true. [Laughter]

**[48:19] Questioner 9:** I've only read one economist where theory fully connected, and that is J.K. Galbraith. I find his work very interesting. One criticism I have of him, and I wonder if it's a general, could be a general criticism of the economic profession. And that is that Galbraith has taken up with analysis and explaining past events. Very little exists in his work that would suggest perhaps new synthesis procedures or how we might *do* something about curing some of the problems or solving some of the problems that he states. In short, my criticism is that he is an economist who's taken up with analysis, with philosophical explaining, and doesn't really suggest how you remedy or solve some of these problems. Is this generally the economics profession?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, I think that Galbraith takes the role of the little boy in the Hans Anderson story who said the Emperor has no clothes. You see, he points out facts about the modern economy which as soon as you mention them, you see they're obvious. And that is very useful in penetrating the mumbo jumbo of the orthodox economists. I don't think it offers any very... program or lead as to what ought to be done. But I think that function which he fulfills is a very useful one.

**[49:55] Questioner 10:** Professor Robinson, what role do you see for the social scientist in today's society and the economist in particular?

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, I've often thought about this question. I once wrote a piece in which I said that all my life I've been employed as a theoretical economist, and I would like to believe that I earned my living honestly. [Laughter]

First of all, I think that they should give up the pretension of being scientists. You see, the natural scientists have established their position by having a method which has yielded fantastic results. I mean, for good or ill, they have succeeded in establishing results. They have two methods. One is control experiment, and the other is exact observation of recurrences in nature.

Now, we obviously can't carry out control experiments. And the recurrences in nature which we want to observe don't recur. Because any important event alters all subsequent events. Like the Great Slump. I mean, the whole situation in the world has been changed by the Great Slump. So we can't observe recurrences.

Therefore, we haven't got a reliable method. I think a great deal of aping of the natural sciences is done enormous harm in economics. I think we ought to take a much more humble view of our possibilities.

And that we should exercise a very high level of self-criticism. You see, the most deplorable thing in economics is the extremely low level of self-criticism which allows people to get away with errant nonsense for 20 or 30 years. They've got their chair, they've got their pupils, and so they can go on propagating their particular nonsense. And this is how the thing goes.

But it is necessary to have social scientists. First of all, since they exist, you want to try and make them better. But anyway, I think it is necessary. I think that the social sciences are, so to say, an organ of self-consciousness in society which is necessary. And the oldest and most important and most useful of the social sciences is still history, after all. History plays a very important role in developing the self-consciousness of society. It may be low-grade chauvinism or it may be a very high and sophisticated level. But it certainly exists and certainly has a social function. And therefore I think we want to peg away and try to develop an honest social science as far as we can.

But I agree with Gunnar Myrdal that it's no good pretending that you haven't got ideological prejudices. And so, anyone who says, "Believe me, I have no prejudices," is either deceived himself or is hoping to deceive you. And therefore, the only way to play the game honestly is to admit what your moral and political conceptions are and put it fairly before the reader. And not pretend that you've got a science or the laws of economics teaches this or that.

**[Chairman]:** Mr. Robinson, I was wondering what application Keynesian analysis might have now in the economies of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China?

**[Joan Robinson]:** What application would Keynesian philosophy have in Russia and China?

**[Chairman]:** Yes.

**[Joan Robinson]:** Well, they don't, of course, have the particular problem of employment policy. Their problems are problems of organization, problems of information, and problems of direction of the line, as the Chinese say. They don't have the particular problem that Keynes was up against. But as a way of looking at the balances within an economy, it's still extremely valuable.

**[Chairman]:** Professor Robinson, I think the rapt attendance, the full house, and the variety of questions is indicative of the deep interest your audience has in your subject. I think you've disturbed us all in our comfortable pew. I don't think there's any economists in Kingston will sleep tonight soundly.

**[Laughter]**

**[Chairman]:** Thank you.

**[Applause]**

**[Chairman]:** See you here Wednesday night for Act 2.
