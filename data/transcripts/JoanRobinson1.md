# **Summary: Joan Robinson on the Chinese Economic System**

In this lecture, economist Joan Robinson discusses the mechanisms of the Chinese economy, specifically focusing on the relationship between the state, the communes, and light industry in the post-Cultural Revolution era. She contrasts the Chinese "wholesale" method of economic control with the "retail" methods of the Soviet Union and market economies.

### **Key Concepts**

* **Wholesale vs. Retail Control:** Robinson argues that the Chinese state controls the economy at the "wholesale" level (purchasing entire outputs via contracts) rather than the "retail" level. This allows the state to dictate the mix of goods based on social need rather than profit maximization.  
* **The "Vegetable Contract" System:**  
  * City authorities sign contracts with surrounding communes to ensure a steady food supply.  
  * Prices are fixed to ensure stability: high purchase prices for farmers to guarantee their income, and low retail prices for consumers.  
  * The city absorbs the loss (subsidies) to maintain this balance, preventing the seasonal "glut and scarcity" cycles typical of market economies.  
* **The "Children's Sizes" Problem:**  
  * In profit-driven systems (including the Soviet model), enterprises prefer producing goods with higher profit margins (e.g., "grown-up socks" vs. "children's socks").  
  * In the Chinese system, the state dictates the assortment of goods required (e.g., ensuring children's sizes are produced) regardless of the profit margin for the individual factory.  
* **Critique of the Soviet Model:**  
  * Robinson critiques the Soviet Union for alienating the peasantry and focusing too heavily on heavy industry at the expense of consumer goods.  
  * She argues the Soviet "profit mechanism" failed to align supply with consumer demand, whereas the Chinese system uses direct feedback from "wholesale agents" (shops) to producers.  
* **Moral vs. Material Incentives:** The lecture highlights the Chinese reliance on political consciousness ("serving the people") rather than purely commercial interests to maintain quality and appropriate supply.

# **Transcript**

**Joan Robinson:** ...Now what I'm going to say is my own idea, I haven't really got any solid evidence for it, but I have the impression that this method of controlling light industry through contracts arose from the way in which they took over the old capitalists in the coastal cities.

There was a development, particularly of textile industry—there was very little heavy industry or engineering or that sort of thing—but there was a certain amount of light industry and there was quite a big development of cotton textiles and silk and so forth in the treaty ports.

And the number of capitalists of course skipped off to Hong Kong or to Taiwan, but those that were left, the patriotic national bourgeoisie, were encouraged to go on producing. And they were linked into the economy by a system of contracts. They were sold raw cotton and these goods were bought from them. And they were allowed a profit margin calculated to cover their costs of production and their wage bill, and a very small profit.

And so the planning authorities bought from the piece goods and supplied them with raw materials. And then they could dispose of the piece goods which they bought through the shops which they sold to the public.

Well, this method is used quite generally throughout the whole economy. That is a system of purchasing on contract. The producers enter into contracts with each other for the supplies of the intermediate goods which they require. And the organ of the Ministry of Internal Trade operates as a wholesale agent.

Now, the producers have all been sucked into the—through the state private system—so now everybody is in the socialist sector. There isn't any private production at all except a very small amount of handicrafts in the communes where they can sell products at the trade fairs. But practically speaking, all production now, big and small, is in the socialist system. But it operates through this method of state wholesaling which controls the production and the retail outlets.

Now, how does this work? The very simple example is the way in which the cities are supplied with vegetables and fruit. The authorities of the city enter into contracts with a number of surrounding communes which agree broadly what supplies will come in and set the prices. And these contracts are broken down into individual arrangements between a particular team in the commune, which is in charge of the vegetable production, and the shop or the street stall or the school which is selling the vegetables in the city.

So it's, so to say, wholesaled notionally, but the actual retailing is brought fresh from the fields to the shop every morning. The team is responsible for bringing the stuff in. In the early days, it was mostly done by handcarts and donkey carts; now they're gradually getting more and more trucks and so the supply comes in that way. But the contract is made directly between the team and the shop: so many cabbages, so many tomatoes, and so forth.

And the prices are organized in such a way that the city authorities break even round the year. The teams which are producing have a steady income. But the public gets the benefit of the supplies coming out.

In the summer flush, the prices are extremely low. In fact, one time I used to go along and they dumped the tomatoes into your basket—it wasn't worthwhile to weigh them, the price was so low it wasn't worth the time to weigh them. But they guarantee a standard income to the producer, they have a standard price which they pay to the producers—the communes—so that their income doesn't fluctuate. But the retail price varies with the supply. So that in the flush season, things are very cheap; in the scarce season, they go up a bit, but they never go very high. And the city authority makes a loss in the summer and a profit in the winter, and works out to balance.

Well this is a very convenient way of overcoming the problem of seasonal supplies. They have higher prices in the spring. There is a sufficient difference in incomes to be able to have a little bit of a luxury market so that some people will buy at the higher price in the spring, and other people will wait until the flush comes. Just make do with cabbages until the fruit comes cheap. So by this means, they could arrange to have a profitable trade in the sense that the city authorities make a small profit, the farmers get a fair income all the year round, and the public gets the benefit of the supplies at low prices.

Well, this is a solution of the problem which is an absolute pest in all capitalist countries: the problem of the farmer who hangs himself in the expectation of plenty. And the waste, of course. We frequently have it—stuff rotting on the trees because it's not worth paying the price to get it picked. When they have a surplus glut, everybody turns out and helps to pick. And the prices are used to clear the market.

Well, the vegetable contracts are sought after because you can get four or five crops from your little bit of ground, so that you're getting money in all the year round. Whereas the people who are growing grain don't get such a big money income. The vegetable people are working for it, but they have heavy expenses. But the vegetable contracts are nice to have because they're doing everything through the contract system. And so the city authorities can place their contracts where they like. As productivity expands, they get a tendency for oversupply, and then the teams will have to reduce their acreage and turn over more land to something else so that they are not squashed.

Now, after the Cultural Revolution, there was a great deal of improvement in everything. One of the things that was improved was making little greenhouses. A very simple thing, you know, two bags of this plastic stuff. By this means, you can bring on vegetables earlier, or tomatoes, and spread out the season.

So one chap I spoke to at a vegetable commune near Peking, he said, "We used to think 'What we grow, they've got to eat.' But now we realize that it's important to meet demand as well as we can, and so we've spread out our season by this device, getting some ripening earlier and some ripening later." And so that this problem of practically throwing away tomatoes during the summer, I suppose, is reduced now because the season is getting supplied to spread out a bit over the year.

Well, this is an example of this method of wholesaling, of keeping supply in touch with demand in a very simple example where you can see it. But the same method is used for all kinds of light industry. The goods are supplied to the shops by the representatives of the ministry, which is in effect a wholesale agent. And the orders are placed with the enterprises.

And by this means, you get an influence of supply—of demand over supply—which operates through the appearance of stocks. See, if stocks are growing ahead of the growth of demand, then the contracts will be altered. And the shops and people keep the information about what is selling well, what seems to be priced too high, what people are complaining of. And then the contracts will be altered.

See, in light industry, a three months' run is quite a reasonable run, so that you can change every three months what they are asked to produce. Now Liu Shaoqi is accused of wanting to use the price mechanism and instruct the enterprises to maximize profits.

Maximizing profits, in this context, simply means making profits in the sense of a return on capital. It means the excess of receipts over costs. And so it's planned for. But... I was given some examples... one very striking example is knitting children's socks. Now, what the people need are children's sizes and grown-up sizes. But the profit margin on the little sock is smaller than on the grown-up sock. So if you pursued profit directly, as Liu Shaoqi wanted to do, we'd be making grown-up socks and not enough children's socks.

Well now, we make it our business to find out what the people are demanding and to make the orders. They get the orders from the shops through the contract to the enterprise. And by this means, they overcome... Now this very problem of the children's sizes and grown-up sizes was a tremendous headache in the Soviet Union. One of the cases they quote of a "successful reform"—that when they allowed the enterprise to charge prices according to demand, they had a big change in the assortment plan and a big increase in the number of children's sizes that they were producing because that was what families wanted to buy.

But in the Chinese scheme, it happened automatically. And this seems to me that this method of operating through contracts has taken them right past the corner in which the Soviet system has jammed up.

One of the necessary conditions for this system to work is that the enterprise is not directly interested in the commercial aspect of production. In Yugoslavia, you gave the workers the equity in the business and then they were in charge of selling, and they therefore became interested in making profits for the market. Similar to the \[Schek?\] scheme which was trying to introduce a system of market control... giving a commercial interest to the enterprise. I believe in Hungary, I haven't been in Hungary, that they have quite a lot of little businesses under guise of being cooperatives—because the agricultural sector is cooperatives—many put up little businesses of dealing and making up. And then they become businesses, they become little capitalists.

And the economic power then goes back to the producers and not to the consumer. But in the Chinese system, the enterprise has absolutely no commercial interest in what it sells or what prices it gets. The output is given to the contract, its own delivery dates, quality, everything is fully specified in the contract. And all they've got to do is to produce what's in the contract efficiently as possible and keep a good morale for their workers. The supplies coming to them, the material they have to make up, is in the plan. If they don't succeed in getting what they need, there's always an element of making do. The Chinese say you must always make a plan which leaves some leeway. For instance, enterprise making shoes, this is actually... this is not a commodity which comes under the national plan, it comes under the province or city plan. So they've been allocated a certain amount of leather, but not enough to keep their own levels of supply, and so then they scrounge round and see if they can't find a bit more or find if they can use some substitutes or rearrange the work in such a way that they can make do. So there's always this element of initiative and local control at the margins. But the broad lines of the plan will allocate to them the materials they need to carry out their output. Their wage bill is given to them. And the prices at which goods change hands are not a matter of interest to the enterprise. Prices are all laid down in lists.

Turnover tax includes a percentage profit which is... and the contract tells them exactly what to produce, the assortment plan. So that they haven't any of the trouble of selling. Which of course in the capitalist system is the big preoccupation of every business. The main call that makes the stuff is the one who has to sell it. This is cut out by the Chinese method.

Now on top of the relation from the consumer through the shops through the contracts, the enterprises make it their business to find out consumer's tastes and get their criticisms. This I think again is a feature which has been very much increased under the influence of the Cultural Revolution. The anti-Liu Shaoqi line, they say. An enterprise, say producing textiles, will send some workers and cadres to a department store and they'll serve at the counter where their goods are being sold and invite the customers to give their remarks, say what they like, what they don't like. And they send people into the country. The shops in the villages are still nominally under the Supply and Marketing Organization, which was set up when there was still private peasants, the first move to get agriculture integrated into the economy was the Supply and Marketing Organization which would take goods to the country and make supplies available. Now of course the communes are all integrated into the national plan through their quota deliveries, which produces contracts. And the shops are still nominally Supply and Marketing Organization, but in fact they are integrated into this wholesaling system.

So the enterprises will send someone to the country or to a canton... and find out what they need. The enterprises are instructed to produce the kind of goods which will be sold in the country—particularly heavy type of bicycle that can be used on dirt roads and a more elegant kind of bicycle to be used in the city.

A great part of Chairman Mao's policy is based on avoiding the mistakes that were made in the Soviet Union. And this was a very notorious mistake in the Soviet Union—perhaps they couldn't be blamed because of the situation they were in—but the scissors crisis which arose from the fact that there was nothing for the peasants to spend money on. Therefore they had no motive to earn money, and therefore they had no motive to sell their crop. This was the impasse that was reached before the collectivization. And collectivization was such a very brutal way of solving the problem that Soviet agriculture has to this day never recovered from it.

But the Chinese system... is for all the main crops—grain, vegetable oil, cotton, tobacco, and so on, all the main crops—each commune has an annual agreement for a quota sale. The commune is responsible for discussing the production with the individual teams. Everything is done on the system from the bottom up and from the top down. And the commune enters into conversation with the county authorities and the result of the commune through the brigades and the teams to discuss the plan which consists of a plan of production and a plan of quota sales.

In principle, a grain-producing commune is supposed to keep enough to feed those families—each team is supposed to keep enough to feed those families round the year—and then they enter into an agreement for selling a quota in excess of that. The quotas are all taken at fixed prices. There is also a land tax, but that's becoming less and less important because it's fixed on the national output in 1951\. And as productivity has increased, the proportion has fallen very much. I think it's about 3 or 4 percent now.

But this system is a way of getting the surplus where it's least painful to part with it. Because a commune in a rich area has a higher output per head, and therefore more available to sell after they fed the families. So the surplus is skimmed off in this way. But the necessary corollary of that is to make the peasants pleased to have money. Be willing to sell. Having a high quota and paid for it doesn't do them any good if they can't spend the money. And the money income will then be distributed to households and accumulation fund kept by the commune. Each brigade will have an accumulation fund. About, say, 60 percent of gross income normally will be distributed. And this can be spent by the households on whatever they like. By some amount from each other's sources and wine and songs can be bought in the grog shop. And they buy textiles, sewing machines, and so on. They also save. And a very interesting way of catching purchasing power back from the family is the... the brigade will have a building team. Now the builders in the northwest where they have these caves... now they build imitation caves with stone. Same shape as a cave, built with stone. Other places they build with bricks. Many communes have their own brick and tile works. And now you can put your name down for a house. Say you're living in a mud house and you'd like to have a brick house. You put your name down for a house. And when you've saved up enough to pay the cost of materials... the banking system within the commune... you're allowed to save this bank and then...

The building team is paid work points. It's no direct commercial relationship between the peasant buying a house and the builders. This again works through the commune organization. This is a very important point in all the money relations within the commune system. For instance, if you're in a vegetable team or a cotton growing team, your whole income will be in money. You make only a bit of the vegetables from your side lot. Broadly speaking, your whole income is given in the form of money, but what you produce is to be sold. Whereas the ordinary run of grain growing... keeping some to feed themselves and selling the surplus.

Well now, a team like that which is growing a cash crop... the people in it are paid work points just the same as the people who are growing grain. They can't buy grain from next door because it's a grain growing \[commune?\]. They're given food. But the grain actually is moved from next door physically, but notionally it's gone from the grain growing \[commune\]... sold to the state... state sells it back to the cotton growers. This seems to me to be a device for preventing corruption from creeping into the system. You see, you never have any direct monetary relations within the commune... apart from this very minor one of selling something through the cooperative shop to people at the local fair.

They very much encourage... very good teams... up to the most stingy level... most brigades have a breeding station where they have people who understand about pigs and know how to treat them and treat their ailments. And they give out piglets to the households. The households feed them with household scraps or with the produce from their private plot or by going out into the country and cutting weeds on the river banks or whatever they can.

The manure from the pig is then sold to the brigade, mixing with soil... and when your pig is ready to be killed, you can either have a grand blowout... feast on the spot... or you can sell it to the shop... government shop... and get meat coupons for it. So then you can spread out your eating of your pig over the year... you haven't got a whole pig to eat at once. Or you can sell it at the local fair.

The local fairs were a question in the during the Cultural Revolution between the Ultra Left and the capitalist roaders. One of the things that Liu Shaoqi was accused of was wanting to build up the local fairs, wanted to give the households a direct economic interest in selling their handicrafts and selling their produce.

Now of course the communes are all integrated into the national plan through their quota deliveries...

*\[Audio cuts to Q\&A session\]*

**Question:** ...about profit.

**Robinson:** Yes. Well, profit, as I say, means the excess of proceeds over costs. And the price is fixed so that there is a profit. If there wasn't a profit, there wouldn't be any accumulation fund. The whole of the national investment comes out of the difference between the costs—which includes the incomes of the workers—and the sales value of the goods. So there must be a profit. The question is, who is interested in the profit? In the capitalist system, the object of the enterprise is to create a profit. In this system, the object of the enterprise is to produce the goods. The profit is something that is collected from them. And the individual enterprise doesn't have any particular interest in whether the profit is great or small.

**Question:** ...consumer demands...

**Robinson:** Well, as I say, the department store sends its people to the factory to say "Look here, these shirts are shrinking," or "These buttons are falling off," or whatever it is. And the factory sends its people to the shop to serve at the counter and hear what the customers say. So there is a very direct relationship. It's not just relying on the market mechanism. It's relying on a human relationship between the people who are concerned.

**Question:** ...affluence...

**Robinson:** Well, they certainly are very far from having an affluent society in the sense of a high level of consumption. But they have a high level of security. Everybody has enough to eat. Everybody has clothes. Everybody has housing. And they are gradually improving their standard of life. But they are very much opposed to the idea of consumerism. They don't want to have a society where people are just vying with each other to have more gadgets. They want to have a society where people are interested in the public good. And the standard of life is rising, but it's rising in a way which is controlled and which is compatible with the general social ideals.
