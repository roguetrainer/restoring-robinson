# **Summary: Joan Robinson on the Crisis in Economic Theory**

In this lecture delivered at an American university (likely in the early 1970s), Joan Robinson outlines what she identifies as the "Second Crisis" in economic theory. She critiques the failure of orthodox economics to address real-world problems such as stagflation, income distribution, and environmental degradation.

### **Key Concepts**

* **The Two Crises of Economic Theory:**  
  * **The First Crisis (The Great Slump):** The inability of pre-Keynesian orthodoxy (Say's Law) to explain mass unemployment during the Great Depression. Keynes resolved this by showing that the state must take responsibility for the level of employment.  
  * **The Second Crisis (Current):** The failure of the "Bastard Keynesian" consensus to explain or solve the combination of inflation and recession (stagflation) and its inability to account for the content of employment (what is actually produced).  
* **"Bastard Keynesianism":**  
  * Robinson coins this term to describe the American interpretation of Keynes, which accepted the tool of deficit spending to maintain employment but stripped away Keynes's social and moral philosophy.  
  * Instead of using public investment for social utility (hospitals, schools), this version relied on the "military-industrial complex" and the arms race to maintain demand without threatening the power of private capital.  
* **The Capital Controversy (Sraffa):**  
  * Robinson discusses the work of Piero Sraffa and the "Cambridge Capital Controversy."  
  * She argues that the neoclassical concept of "capital" as a measurable factor of production (independent of distribution) is logically circular. One cannot determine the value of capital without knowing the rate of profit, and thus one cannot explain the rate of profit as the "marginal product" of capital.  
  * This destroys the orthodox justification for the distribution of income (i.e., that profit is the just reward for the contribution of capital).  
* **Growth vs. Quality of Life:**  
  * She critiques the obsession with "Growth" (GNP) as a panacea.  
  * She points out that statistical growth often masks the production of "anti-social" goods (armaments) and ignores negative externalities like pollution and environmental destruction.

**Host:** ...she got into economics because she told me that she got under the influence of Sraffa from the early beginnings and she is still at it and I think she is still at it very effectively, so we are very happy to have her here today.

I would also like to bring your attention to...

**Introducer:** ...task because it turns out Joan Robinson is familiar to almost everybody who has the vaguest understanding or connection with or familiarity with economics and the development of economics.

I think that of all existing economists, she has perhaps been the singular figure who has served at the forefront of every major revolution in economic thought in this century. Beginning with the revolution in the theory of imperfect competition, and going through the Keynesian revolution, where she herself played a major part not only in formulating the initial ideas of Keynes but in developing it and advancing it beyond the point at which Keynes left off.

In addition, after the Keynesian revolution, the whole confrontation and controversy over the theory of capital, she played a major part in defining the issues and formulating some of the approaches to that problem. And finally, in the theory of growth and development, she has also played a major and important role. So for all of these reasons, I don't think it is necessary for me to mention in any detail who or what Mrs. Robinson is.

She is now, I might just add, Professor Emeritus at Cambridge University and visiting us for about ten days, in the course of which she's been having discussions with people here, and this is the origin then of today's talk.

In closing, let me just mention one big point, which is for those of you who are not yet familiar with it, I would strongly recommend that you have a look at her most recent book, written jointly with John Eatwell, called *Modern Economics*. It should be in the bookstore; if it isn't, then get some additional copies soon. So without further ado, I introduce Mrs. Robinson.

**Joan Robinson:** I want to talk about the crisis in economic theory. And I want to explain what I mean by the crisis.

I'm drawing a parallel between the position now and the position in 1930\. In 1930, there was a crisis in economic theory because the orthodoxy of those days—the laisser-faire orthodoxy—taught that the free play of market forces would always establish an equilibrium with full employment of available labor. Supply creates its own demand.

And while the economists were teaching this, in the world, the Great Slump was occurring. The whole world economy was breaking down. There were millions of workers unemployed. The stats were going down into the pit. And Hitler was coming into power in Germany.

And the economists were saying that it is impossible for such a thing to happen.

Well, this was an obvious conflict between the orthodox theory and the reality of the world, which was too great to be papered over. And it was in that setting that Keynes produced his revolution—the theory of employment—which showed that there is no self-righting mechanism in the market system, and that if you want to have a high level of employment, the state must take responsibility for it.

Now, this was a very great shock to the orthodoxy of those days. And it was very largely resisted. In this country particularly, it was very much resisted. But then came the war. And the war cured the slump.

And after the war, it was impossible to go back to the old laisser-faire doctrine. It was obvious that the government had to take responsibility for the level of employment. But at the same time, the old orthodoxy puts up a tremendous resistance. And in the United States, they produced what I call "Bastard Keynesianism."

That is to say, they accepted the cynical tool of management of effective demand, but they wouldn't accept the philosophy of Keynes. Keynes was concerned with the question: Employment for what?

He showed that it is possible to maintain employment by digging holes in the ground and filling them up again. But he said it would be more sensible to build houses and roads and schools. But the Bastard Keynesians didn't want to have the government interfering in the valuable, profitable spheres of investment. And so they invented the idea that you can keep up employment by the armaments industry.

So we have this situation of the "military-industrial complex" which has kept the economy going for twenty-five years.

But now, we have a second crisis. The first crisis was the breakdown of the theory that the market produces full employment. The second crisis is a breakdown of the theory that the market produces an equilibrium of supply and demand for products.

We have now a situation of rising prices and falling employment. Stagnation and inflation at the same time. And the orthodox theory has no answer to it. They are completely bankrupt. They don't know what to say.

Mr. Nixon sets up a Prices and Incomes Board. He takes it down. He puts it back again. He doesn't know what he's doing. He hasn't got a theory to explain how the economy works.

And this is the second crisis. And the second crisis is much more serious than the first. Because the remedy for the first crisis—which was to increase government expenditure—was very pleasant. It was very easy to persuade people to accept it. But the remedy for the second crisis involves dealing with the distribution of income. It involves dealing with the question of the relative shares of wages and profits. And this is a very painful subject which the orthodox theory has always tried to keep out of sight.

So we are now in a situation where the economists are really helpless. They have no advice to give.

Now, I want to talk a little bit about the theoretical background of this situation. The theoretical background is the breakdown of the idea of the market equilibrium.

And here I want to bring in the name of Sraffa. Sraffa was a contemporary of Keynes. He was in Cambridge. He was a very close friend of Keynes. And he was arguing with Keynes and helping him to produce the *General Theory*. But he never accepted the Keynesian analysis as a final statement. He always wanted to go deeper.

And he spent his life working on a very difficult and abstract book called *Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities*. It came out in 1960\. And it took a long time for people to understand it. But now it is beginning to have its effect.

And the main point of Sraffa's analysis is to show that there is no such thing as a "quantity of capital" which can be measured independently of the distribution of income.

You see, the orthodox theory says that there are factors of production: land, labor, and capital. And each factor receives a reward equal to its marginal product. The marginal product of labor determines the wage. The marginal product of capital determines the profit.

But Sraffa shows that you cannot measure the quantity of capital unless you already know the rate of profit. So the whole argument is circular. You can't say that the rate of profit is determined by the marginal product of capital, because you can't find the marginal product of capital until you know the rate of profit.

Now, this is a very difficult logical point. And there was a great controversy about it, which is known as the "Cambridge Controversy"—between Cambridge, England and Cambridge, Massachusetts. And Cambridge, Massachusetts had to admit that they were wrong. Professor Samuelson, who is a very honest man, admitted that he had been wrong and that the Cambridge, England argument was correct.

But then he went on teaching the same old stuff in his textbook just as if nothing had happened.

So we have this situation where the logical foundation of the orthodox theory has been destroyed. But the teaching goes on just the same. And the reason for this is that they have to have some ideology to defend the system. They have to have some way of saying that the distribution of income is just. That the worker gets what he produces and the capitalist gets what he produces.

And if you take away the theory of the marginal product of capital, you have no explanation of why the capitalist gets a profit. You have to admit that it is simply a property right. That he owns the means of production and therefore he can exact a share of the product.

And this, of course, brings the argument back to the classical economists—to Ricardo and Marx. They understood perfectly well that the distribution of income depends on the power of the different classes.

Now, this theoretical breakdown is connected with the practical breakdown. Because if you don't understand the nature of the distribution of income, you can't deal with the problem of inflation.

The inflation we have now is not a monetary phenomenon. It is not due to too much money chasing too few goods. It is due to a struggle over the distribution of income. The workers want a higher standard of life. The capitalists want to maintain their profit margins. And the only way they can do it is by raising prices.

So you have a spiral of rising wages and rising prices. And the government doesn't know how to stop it. If they cut down demand, they cause unemployment, but they don't stop the rise in prices. Because the trade unions are strong enough to keep up wages even when there is unemployment.

So we have this phenomenon of "stagflation"—stagnation and inflation together.

And this brings me to the question of growth. You see, the answer to all these problems was supposed to be "Growth." If we just have enough growth, everybody will be better off. We don't need to worry about who gets what, because everybody will get more.

But now we are finding that growth is not the answer. In the first place, growth of what? If you have growth of armaments, growth of luxury goods, growth of pollution—this doesn't make people better off.

And secondly, we are running into the limits of the physical environment. We are consuming the resources of the planet at a terrifying rate. We are destroying the atmosphere. We are poisoning the rivers.

So the idea that you can solve the social problems by unlimited growth is turning out to be a mirage.

So we are brought back to the fundamental questions of political economy. What is the economy for? Who should benefit from it? How should it be controlled?

And the orthodox theory has no answer to these questions. It just goes on repeating the old formulas about the free market and the marginal productivity of factors.

So that is why I say there is a crisis in economic theory. It is a crisis because the theory has lost contact with reality. And it is unable to give any guidance to the problems that are actually facing us.

Now, I haven't got a cut-and-dried solution to offer you. I can't pull a rabbit out of a hat and say, "Here is the answer." But I think the first step is to clear away the rubbish. To clear away the old obfuscations and the old apologetics. And to look at the reality of the situation with open eyes.

We have to recognize that the economic system is a system of power. It is not a system of natural equilibrium. It is a system in which different groups struggle for power. And the outcome depends on who has the most power.

And we have to recognize that the market system, left to itself, produces disastrous results. It produces inequality. It produces instability. It produces pollution. It produces war.

So we have to look for a different way of organizing our affairs. A way which is based on human needs and social justice, not on the blind play of market forces.

And that is the task for the new generation of economists. You have to go back to the great tradition of political economy. You have to study the classical economists. You have to study Marx. You have to study Keynes. And you have to use your own brains to work out a theory that is relevant to the world you live in.

Thank you.
