# **Summary: Q\&A Session \- The Blight of Conventional Economics**

This file covers the Question and Answer session following Joan Robinson's lecture on development economics. The discussion moves between specific historical examples (China, USSR, India) and high-level theoretical debates about the validity of orthodox economics.

### **Key Topics and Debates**

* **The Relevance of "High Theory" to the Third World:**  
  * A central tension in the Q\&A is the link between Robinson's theoretical work (the critique of the aggregate production function) and practical development.  
  * **The Challenge:** A questioner asks why the logical inconsistencies of capital theory matter to a developing nation. Why isn't it just an academic game?  
  * **Robinson's Defense:** She argues that neoclassical theory is used to justify the status quo (e.g., free trade, foreign investment). By proving the theory is logically incoherent (circular reasoning regarding capital and profits), one destroys its authority. This frees Third World economists to look at their reality without "ideological spectacles."  
* **Technology Transfer and Unemployment:**  
  * Robinson reiterates that importing "Western" capital-intensive technology into labor-abundant countries is disastrous. It creates a small "aristocracy of labor" while leaving the mass of the population unemployed.  
  * She advocates for "intermediate technology" (though she doesn't use that exact phrase here, she describes the concept)—using labor-intensive methods for infrastructure (canals, roads) to employ the population, rather than waiting for expensive machines.  
* **Comparative Development Models:**  
  * **China vs. USSR:** She acknowledges the brutality of Soviet industrialization ("primitive accumulation") but argues it successfully built an industrial base. She contrasts this with China's attempt to develop agriculture and industry simultaneously ("walking on two legs") without squeezing the peasantry as hard.  
  * **North vs. South (Vietnam/Korea):** When asked about development in divided nations, she argues that the socialist Norths (at that time) had achieved more autonomous, broad-based development compared to the "dependent" development of the Souths, which relied on foreign capital and served elite consumption.  
* **The "Infant Industry" Argument:**  
  * Robinson uses the history of the British textile industry to attack modern Free Trade dogma. Britain protected its own industries against superior Indian textiles until they were strong enough to compete, then preached Free Trade to the rest of the world. She argues developing nations today need the same freedom to protect their "infant industries."

# **Transcript**

**Joan Robinson:** ...mistakes in our work. To say that development was rather unbalanced. They'd done a tremendous amount of investment. And so not all the investment projects had been completed by the time the cutback had to be made.

There were also political mistakes. So it was partly due to mistakes, partly due to the bad weather which was quite disastrous, and partly due to the fact that the Russian technicians were suddenly withdrawn right in the middle of this crisis.

But... after the three years of... a series of good harvests set in. And development went ahead. And a great deal of the investment that was carried out during the Great Leap turned out to be extremely useful. So that enormous amount of irrigation works, amount of construction, amount of... setting up factories and so on. All this came into play after the harvests had recovered.

So the idea that the Great Leap was a failure... or basically a mistake... is not... is not very plausible. Anyway, I don't think it's got anything whatever to do with the policy of "walking on two legs."

\[Question from Audience \- Audio somewhat muffled\]  
Questioner: ...I'd like to know how you contrast... if you do... the policy you prescribed of... a country seizing control of its own resources and then the intellectuals of that country decide how it's to arrange its own destiny, its own development... how you contrast that to the course of Russian development following the Russian Revolution, which to my mind at least was largely dependent on slave labor and the imperialist exploitation of Eastern Europe following World War II.  
**Robinson:** Well... The history of the Soviet Union of course is very... interesting and a very terrible story. But I don't quite see what it's got to do with this.

*\[Audience member clarifies/continues\]*

**Robinson:** Please stand up, please.

**Questioner:** I don't really understand what you mean when you say that... intellectuals in underdeveloped countries are led down the wrong path because... or duped by neoclassical economic theory because it seems that... that is more a problem of the... of students of economics and and teachers... of economics in the United States... that in Third World countries it's more... uh... a choice of... for... of... oppression, that sort of thing... not not a... being duped or or tricked or... actually believing in in the existence of a... of competitive capitalism...

**Robinson:** You mean they come here knowing what they're doing?

**Questioner:** Yes.

**Robinson:** See... there's a very big effort being made by the United States... to educate the intellectual elite of the Third World countries... and insofar as they educate them in economics, they educate them in all this stuff. And... they they go home carrying on the tradition... teaching this stuff... and preventing them from looking at the real problems of their country.

**Questioner:** To what do you attribute the failure of... Allende's Chile?

*\[Laughter/Murmuring\]*

**Robinson:** Well... he... he didn't... quickly enough get enough support... to be able to stand up against the... the... military... who were defending the... interest of the middle class... and of dollar imperialism.

**Questioner:** Could you could you say a few words about the policy of walking on two legs in relation to to the development of North Vietnam... and maybe contrast it to what's happening in South Vietnam?

**Robinson:** I'm sorry?

**Questioner:** Could you could you say a few words about North Vietnam... and the development... of the economy in a small country which isn't China... which which seems to be maintaining a lot of old traditional things... while while still developing.

**Robinson:** Yes. I mean clearly there... there's a big contrast between the way the situation is developing in those two parts. There's an even more striking case and that is North Korea and South Korea.

Uh... North Korea... I think is an example to show that the "economies of scale" are not so important after all. Because they built up... their whole place was smashed completely flat. I mean not one stone standing on another. They had a little bit of industry they kept going in caves in the mountains and in underground works. But it was it was completely devastated.

Well they set about reconstructing the country. They'd formerly been the food deficit area... the rice bowls in the South. They got their agriculture... up to the point of being able to feed themselves... and they developed a whole range of modern industry. They... they have very good mineral resources... that was a good foundation for them. They built up a vehicle industry... machine machine making industry of all kinds. They're making... in small packets... you've got... one five year plan they they produced five diesel locomotives... and 2,000 trucks... and uh... 1,500 tractors, this sort of thing, you see.

And then they managed to build up their industry... and now they're quite a formidable industrial country. Their main stress was on education. Everybody went to school. And they... their uh... workers and technicians worked together to find out how to manage all this technology. And they built up this economy which has light industry... heavy industry... agriculture... education... health service... housing and so on... looked after.

Well... in the uh... in the South Korea... they developed on the basis of cheap labor... they have an export industry... just a nice example for... uh... free trade theory. See they have an export industry based on low wages... cheap labor... and... uh... import substitutions... and they have a very divided society.

And as for people being in jail as the point was made here... it's an extremely... brutal tyranny which keeps the country together. Now here you have a... a contrast between two ways of development... in the country of the same people. So there can't be any historical difference.

**Questioner:** Is there a differential impact from the investment by... of... uh... capital or funds... surplus of some kind... from socialist countries in Third World countries? For example, the uh... Russian investments in the oil industry in Iran. Is there a different impact between the investment of those... that surplus... and the surplus from capital... and if so what is that difference?

**Robinson:** What do you mean the surplus? You mean the finance?

**Questioner:** Yes.

**Robinson:** Yes. Well I think the... they are pursuing very different policies. The the... Soviets uh... are giving aid to build up the economies of the countries which they think will support them. The capitalists are giving it giving... to the countries where they think they can find profitable markets.

**Questioner:** Well in the case of the Iranian oil... the uh... Russian investment is very much like the investment of the Western oil companies. That is that is an extractive industry... uh... which takes natural gas or oil from Iran... across the border and so on. And that's not a a form of aid.

**Robinson:** No, it's not a form of aid. It's... it's a good business for them. They want the... they want the oil and the Persians have got it.

**Questioner:** But what is is that a differential impact of that on the local economy? Compared to the investment of the Western capitalists? Or the large uh... Western oil corporations?

**Robinson:** Well... as far as it's the oil industry I suppose the effect is the same. But the arrangement for the market is quite different.

**Questioner:** \[Partially inaudible\] ...If in your talk you mentioned that you had some disagreements with uh... Professor Baran... I wonder if you could talk about uh... that a little bit. Specific disagreements that you had with some of the main arguments.

**Robinson:** Well... I think he he took too simple a view of some of these problems. I can't remember... take take the Baran and Sweezy book, you see. *Monopoly Capital*. There... the whole argument turns on the idea that... under monopoly... profit margins are raised... the share of profit is raised... the rate of exploitation is raised.

Well this seemed to me to be... uh... just uh... taking over the... taking over the idea from the textbooks... that competition is all right... and monopoly is wrong. I don't think that when the American economy was competitive... the share of profits was... necessarily less. They don't... certainly give us any... any evidence for it. So you have competition... as long as the economy is expanding fast enough... to make a sellers' market. When the supply overtakes demand... you get into a buyers' market... then they begin to form rings to defend themselves. But I don't see how you can say that competition necessarily has lower profit margins. So I think he picked up a... an idea... and ran off with it... without really examining it.

**Questioner:** What... I would like to ask you... how you think less developed countries should finance their development? If they rely on foreign countries... say foreign capitalist countries... clearly a lot of the profit... a lot of the surplus will be expropriated. But if they rely on domestic capitalists... local capitalists... then as in the case of Mexico and Brazil you get a very... unequal society developing. So I would like to ask you how you think less developed countries should finance their development? And whether you think it can be done without a socialist revolution.

**Robinson:** Well... the Chinese financed their development without creating an unequal society. That's certainly true. That's how... how can it be done without a socialist revolution? Well that's the question. I mean the... the Chinese method of finance... is... they have... stable prices... they have rising money incomes... and they sell the product... at a price which clips off a profit... which is the accumulation fund.

It's... it's very simple. You see... prices are stable. Wages are slowly rising. But the rise in productivity is much greater than the rise in wages. So the profit margin is growing all the time. That provides the fund for investment. And they don't have any inflation.

**Questioner:** \[Inaudible \- asking for a specific answer regarding financing\]

**Robinson:** I thought you were saying... asking me... whether it can be done without a socialist revolution. Well... it's difficult to see how you can... mobilize the surplus... without having control of the economy.

**Questioner:** \[Inaudible\] ...about the Great Leap Forward...

**Robinson:** ...mistakes in our work. To say that development was rather unbalanced...

*\[Note: The transcript loops back to the start of the audio file here. The Q\&A continues with discussion on the definition of equilibrium and the relevance of "High Theory."\]*

**Questioner:** ...from the discussion of... Mrs. Robinson... Professor Pencavel... Professor David... It seems to me there is a little confusion on the level of the discussion. It seems to me that there are three fundamental points... \[Discussion on logic vs empiricism vs relevance\].

**Robinson:** I want to discuss this... in a logic... contradiction... in its own logic. The old neoclassical doctrine... was primarily the defense of laisser-faire... free trade... the gold standard... balanced budgets... no government interference... and so on.

Now this... means in practice... that this is... a device... for preventing protection... preventing the creation of industries in the backward countries.

If you have free trade... the manufactured goods... can undersell the handmade goods... and the people want to buy them... well they ought to be allowed to buy them. But looking at it from the point of view of the Indian economy... see... the advantage to the consumer is a little bit extra... but they have to pay the price of the whole cost of goods. So that the handloom industry which has disappeared is a loss to the nation.

**Questioner:** ...The question that I want to address Mrs. Robinson... more concrete terms... I think many of us were feeling that... the lack of ability of a given theory... to explain what's going on... and to give us a picture about the world. To be more concrete for example... Mrs. Robinson... to the point of risk... she said for example there was attempt in neoclassical theory to approach risk through expected utility... she basically tried to say that we have to ignore the problem of probability... and to try to approach expectation in a different way.

**Robinson:** This business about Arrow-Debreu... I think is a red herring because Arrow-Debreu is not even trying to tell us... anything about the problems we are interested in.

But I was accusing Samuelson of making a definite mistake... depicting different positions of equilibrium and then... assuming that you can move from one to the other by a process of accumulation.

Now... let's consider... let's go back to this Walrasian economy... uh... Harry Johnson... Now as you can compare two economies... one has a larger lump of putty than the other...

*\[Robinson repeats her critique of the putty-capital model and the logical impossibility of measuring capital without a prior rate of profit.\]*

**Robinson:** ...This seems to me to be a very strange notion. Furthermore the concept of stability... which is used in economics... is based on a mechanical analogy... which is not appropriate to economic problems. The analogy of the pendulum swinging... of weights in a scale... and so on. Now in all these mechanical relationships... you can go to and fro. You put weights into one scale... it goes down. You take them out again... it goes up.

The movement in time... is not of that nature. Movement in time... is always going from the past into the future. And any change is bound to to affect expectations... and therefore the decisions of the people who are involved. So that this notion of a movement into equilibrium... being of the same nature as a mechanical movement... is totally... false. And the whole methodology... of equilibrium theory... is completely at fault.

Now... there's a very nice book I recommend to everybody... by Jack Chen... called *A Year in Upper Felicity*. He... went with some other cadres... when they went down to the country... and he lived... for one year in this village. And he gives you an account... daily life of the people... and the... decisions... and... one thing happened... he was sitting with a woman with her baby... and they'd just been... gathering the corn... and she looked at the harvest... the small harvest of corn... and lifted up the baby... and said... "How shall we get through the winter?"

Now Chinese... they had harvest failures... in 1960, 61, 62\. But nobody starved. They had... a rationing system... which meant that everybody got... a share of whatever grain there was. It was very little. They were very hungry. But they didn't starve.

And this... security... which they have... is the great triumph of the Chinese system. It hasn't made them rich. It hasn't made them prosperous in our sense. But it has given them a sense of security... and a sense of dignity... which they never had before.

So... I think we have a lot to learn... from looking at the world... as it really is... and not through these spectacles... of equilibrium theory.

Thank you.
